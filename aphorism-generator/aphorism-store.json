Is there not ground for\n      suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists,\n      have failed to understand women—that the terrible seriousness and\n      clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to\n      Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman?\n      Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every\n      kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it\n      stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen,\n      that all dogma lies on the ground—nay more, that it is at its last\n      gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all\n      dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and\n      decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and\n      tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again\n      understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and\n      absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared:\n      perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the\n      soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition,\n      has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a\n      deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very\n      restricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The\n      philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for\n      thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in\n      the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience\n      have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to\n      its \"super-terrestrial\" pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of\n      architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart\n      of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander\n      about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic\n      philosophy has been a caricature of this kind—for instance, the\n      Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be\n      ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst,\n      the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a\n      dogmatist error—namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the\n      Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of\n      this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a\n      healthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs\n      of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It\n      amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE—the\n      fundamental condition—of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as\n      Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How did such a\n      malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked\n      Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\n      youths, and deserved his hemlock?\" But the struggle against Plato, or—to\n      speak plainer, and for the \"people\"—the struggle against the\n      ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY\n      IS PLATONISM FOR THE \"PEOPLE\"), produced in Europe a magnificent tension\n      of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely\n      strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact,\n      the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts\n      have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of\n      Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment—which,\n      with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in\n      fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in\n      \"distress\"! (The Germans invented gunpowder—all credit to them! but\n      they again made things square—they invented printing.) But we, who\n      are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD\n      EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the\n      distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the\n      arrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....", "1": " The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise,\n      the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken\n      with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us!\n      What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long\n      story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we\n      at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That\n      this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it\n      really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this \"Will to Truth\"\n      in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of\n      this Will—until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a\n      yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will.\n      Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty?\n      Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before\n      us—or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of\n      us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous\n      of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it\n      at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as\n      if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING\n      it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.", "2": " \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth\n      out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the\n      generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the\n      wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams\n      of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must\n      have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own—in this transitory,\n      seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and\n      cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being,\n      in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itself—THERE\n      must be their source, and nowhere else!\"—This mode of reasoning\n      discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can\n      be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical\n      procedure; through this \"belief\" of theirs, they exert themselves for\n      their \"knowledge,\" for something that is in the end solemnly christened\n      \"the Truth.\" The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN\n      ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to\n      doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most\n      necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, \"DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.\"\n      For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and\n      secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon\n      which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely\n      superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being\n      probably made from some corner, perhaps from below—\"frog\n      perspectives,\" as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters.\n      In spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and\n      the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental\n      value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to\n      delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It might even be possible that\n      WHAT constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists\n      precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to\n      these evil and apparently opposed things—perhaps even in being\n      essentially identical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern\n      himself with such dangerous \"Perhapses\"! For that investigation one must\n      await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will have other\n      tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalent—philosophers\n      of the dangerous \"Perhaps\" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all\n      seriousness, I see such new philosophers beginning to appear.", "3": " Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their\n      lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of conscious\n      thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so\n      even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as\n      one learned anew about heredity and \"innateness.\" As little as the act of\n      birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of\n      heredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" OPPOSED to the instinctive\n      in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a\n      philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into\n      definite channels. And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of\n      movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological\n      demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For example, that\n      the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less\n      valuable than \"truth\" such valuations, in spite of their regulative\n      importance for US, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations,\n      special kinds of niaiserie, such as may be necessary for the\n      maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing, in effect, that man is\n      not just the \"measure of things.\"", "4": " The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is\n      here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question\n      is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,\n      species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally\n      inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic\n      judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without\n      a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with\n      the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a\n      constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not\n      live—that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation\n      of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE;\n      that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous\n      manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed\n      itself beyond good and evil.", "5": " That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and\n      half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they are—how\n      often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how\n      childish and childlike they are,—but that there is not enough honest\n      dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when\n      the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. They\n      all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained\n      through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic\n      (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of\n      \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or\n      \"suggestion,\" which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and\n      refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event.\n      They are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally\n      astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub \"truths,\"—and\n      VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself,\n      very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to\n      let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful\n      confidence and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant,\n      equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic\n      by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his \"categorical imperative\"—makes\n      us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the\n      subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers. Or, still more so,\n      the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has, as it\n      were, clad his philosophy in mail and mask—in fact, the \"love of HIS\n      wisdom,\" to translate the term fairly and squarely—in order thereby\n      to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare\n      to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:—how\n      much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a\n      sickly recluse betray!", "6": " It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till\n      now has consisted of—namely, the confession of its originator, and a\n      species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that\n      the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the\n      true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to\n      understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher\n      have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself:\n      \"What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\" Accordingly, I do not believe\n      that an \"impulse to knowledge\" is the father of philosophy; but that\n      another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and\n      mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the\n      fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may\n      have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find\n      that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that\n      each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the\n      ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other\n      impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to\n      philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really\n      scientific men, it may be otherwise—\"better,\" if you will; there\n      there may really be such a thing as an \"impulse to knowledge,\" some kind\n      of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away\n      industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses\n      taking any material part therein. The actual \"interests\" of the scholar,\n      therefore, are generally in quite another direction—in the family,\n      perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost\n      indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and\n      whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom\n      specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or\n      that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing\n      impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive\n      testimony as to WHO HE IS,—that is to say, in what order the deepest\n      impulses of his nature stand to each other.", "7": " How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging than\n      the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists;\n      he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense, and on the face of\n      it, the word signifies \"Flatterers of Dionysius\"—consequently,\n      tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as\n      much as to say, \"They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them\"\n      (for Dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is\n      really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was\n      annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato\n      and his scholars were masters—of which Epicurus was not a master!\n      He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat concealed in his little\n      garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and\n      ambitious envy of Plato, who knows! Greece took a hundred years to find\n      out who the garden-god Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?", "8": " There is a point in every philosophy at which the \"conviction\" of the\n      philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient\n      mystery:\n      \n      Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.", "9": " You desire to LIVE \"according to Nature\"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what\n      fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly\n      extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,\n      without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:\n      imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power—how COULD you live in\n      accordance with such indifference? To live—is not that just\n      endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,\n      preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And\n      granted that your imperative, \"living according to Nature,\" means actually\n      the same as \"living according to life\"—how could you do DIFFERENTLY?\n      Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must\n      be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend\n      to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something\n      quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In\n      your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature\n      herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be\n      Nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and would like everything to be made after\n      your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of\n      Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so\n      long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature\n      FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it\n      otherwise—and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives\n      you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over\n      yourselves—Stoicism is self-tyranny—Nature will also allow\n      herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But\n      this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the\n      Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe\n      in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do\n      otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most\n      spiritual Will to Power, the will to \"creation of the world,\" the will to\n      the causa prima.", "10": " The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which\n      the problem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at present\n      throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who\n      hears only a \"Will to Truth\" in the background, and nothing else, cannot\n      certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may\n      really have happened that such a Will to Truth—a certain extravagant\n      and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hope—has\n      participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of\n      \"certainty\" to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even\n      be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust\n      in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something. But that is\n      Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul,\n      notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It\n      seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who\n      are still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak\n      superciliously of \"perspective,\" in that they rank the credibility of\n      their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence\n      that \"the earth stands still,\" and thus, apparently, allowing with\n      complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at\n      present believe in more firmly than in one's body?),—who knows if\n      they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an\n      even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of\n      former times, perhaps the \"immortal soul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in\n      short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more\n      vigorously and more joyously, than by \"modern ideas\"? There is DISTRUST of\n      these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all\n      that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some\n      slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the\n      BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called\n      Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined\n      taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these\n      reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true,\n      except this motleyness. Therein it seems to me that we should agree with\n      those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present\n      day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is\n      unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us! The main thing\n      about them is NOT that they wish to go \"back,\" but that they wish to get\n      AWAY therefrom. A little MORE strength, swing, courage, and artistic\n      power, and they would be OFF—and not back!", "11": " It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to\n      divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German\n      philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon\n      himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories;\n      with it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult thing that could\n      ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" Let us only understand this\n      \"could be\"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the\n      faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself\n      in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy\n      depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the\n      younger generation to discover if possible something—at all events\n      \"new faculties\"—of which to be still prouder!—But let us\n      reflect for a moment—it is high time to do so. \"How are synthetic\n      judgments a priori POSSIBLE?\" Kant asks himself—and what is really\n      his answer? \"BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"—but unfortunately not in\n      five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of\n      German profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight\n      of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were\n      beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation\n      reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man—for\n      at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the \"Politics\n      of hard fact.\" Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young\n      theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves—all\n      seeking for \"faculties.\" And what did they not find—in that\n      innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which\n      Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet\n      distinguish between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all a faculty for the\n      \"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and\n      thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally\n      pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this\n      exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,\n      notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile\n      conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral\n      indignation. Enough, however—the world grew older, and the dream\n      vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still\n      rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost—old\n      Kant. \"By means of a means (faculty)\"—he had said, or at least meant\n      to say. But, is that—an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather\n      merely a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? \"By\n      means of a means (faculty),\" namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the\n      doctor in Moliere,\n\n      \n    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,\n    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\n\n      \nBut such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to\n      replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI\n      possible?\" by another question, \"Why is belief in such judgments\n      necessary?\"—in effect, it is high time that we should understand\n      that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the\n      preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might\n      naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and\n      readily—synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at\n      all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\n      judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as\n      plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of\n      life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which \"German\n      philosophy\"—I hope you understand its right to inverted commas\n      (goosefeet)?—has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is\n      no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to\n      German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the\n      mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political\n      obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still\n      overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this,\n      in short—\"sensus assoupire.\"...", "12": " As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted\n      theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no\n      one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification\n      to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means\n      of expression)—thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole\n      Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents\n      of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe,\n      contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich\n      has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that \"stood fast\" of\n      the earth—the belief in \"substance,\" in \"matter,\" in the\n      earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the\n      senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still\n      further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the\n      \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places\n      where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated \"metaphysical\n      requirements\": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that\n      other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and\n      longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this\n      expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\n      eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be\n      expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to\n      get rid of \"the soul\" thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and\n      most venerated hypotheses—as happens frequently to the clumsiness of\n      naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing\n      it. But the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the\n      soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of\n      subjective multiplicity,\" and \"soul as social structure of the instincts\n      and passions,\" want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In\n      that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions\n      which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the\n      idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new\n      desert and a new distrust—it is possible that the older\n      psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually,\n      however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT—and,\n      who knows? perhaps to DISCOVER the new.", "13": " Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the\n      instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic\n      being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength—life\n      itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and\n      most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else, let us\n      beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!—one of which is the\n      instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency). It\n      is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy\n      of principles.", "14": " It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural\n      philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to\n      us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is\n      based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time\n      to come must be regarded as more—namely, as an explanation. It has\n      eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of\n      its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon\n      an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes—in fact, it follows\n      instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is\n      clear, what is \"explained\"? Only that which can be seen and felt—one\n      must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the\n      Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted\n      precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence—perhaps among men\n      who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our\n      contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining\n      masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional\n      networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses—the\n      mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and\n      interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT\n      different from that which the physicists of today offer us—and\n      likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological\n      workers, with their principle of the \"smallest possible effort,\" and the\n      greatest possible blunder. \"Where there is nothing more to see or to\n      grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do\"—that is certainly\n      an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding\n      be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and\n      bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.", "15": " To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the\n      fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the\n      idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!\n      Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as\n      heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world is\n      the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external\n      world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves\n      would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete\n      REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something\n      fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of\n      our organs—?", "16": " There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are\n      \"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" or as the superstition\n      of Schopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as though cognition here got hold of\n      its object purely and simply as \"the thing in itself,\" without any\n      falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the\n      object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate\n      certainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in itself,\"\n      involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from\n      the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may think\n      that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say\n      to himself: \"When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence,\n      'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative\n      proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that\n      it is I who think, that there must necessarily be something that\n      thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being\n      who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that it\n      is already determined what is to be designated by thinking—that I\n      KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what\n      it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just\n      happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In short, the assertion\n      'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with\n      other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on\n      account of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has,\n      at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.\"—In place of the\n      \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may believe in the special case,\n      the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to\n      him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: \"Whence did\n      I get the notion of 'thinking'? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What\n      gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause,\n      and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought?\" He who ventures to answer\n      these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE\n      perception, like the person who says, \"I think, and know that this, at\n      least, is true, actual, and certain\"—will encounter a smile and two\n      notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher\n      will perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not\n      mistaken, but why should it be the truth?\"", "17": " With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of\n      emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these\n      credulous minds—namely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes, and\n      not when \"I\" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to\n      say that the subject \"I\" is the condition of the predicate \"think.\" ONE\n      thinks; but that this \"one\" is precisely the famous old \"ego,\" is, to put\n      it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an\n      \"immediate certainty.\" After all, one has even gone too far with this \"one\n      thinks\"—even the \"one\" contains an INTERPRETATION of the process,\n      and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here according to\n      the usual grammatical formula—\"To think is an activity; every\n      activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"... It was pretty\n      much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides the\n      operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it resides and out of\n      which it operates—the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at\n      last to get along without this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we\n      shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to get\n      along without the little \"one\" (to which the worthy old \"ego\" has refined\n      itself).", "18": " It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable;\n      it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems\n      that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the \"free will\" owes its\n      persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels\n      himself strong enough to refute it.", "19": " Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the\n      best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to\n      understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and\n      completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again\n      seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers\n      are in the habit of doing—he seems to have adopted a POPULAR\n      PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above all\n      something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name—and it\n      is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the\n      mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So\n      let us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let us say\n      that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely,\n      the sensation of the condition \"AWAY FROM WHICH we go,\" the sensation of\n      the condition \"TOWARDS WHICH we go,\" the sensation of this \"FROM\" and\n      \"TOWARDS\" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation,\n      which, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\" commences its\n      action by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything. Therefore, just as\n      sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as\n      ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be\n      recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought;—and\n      let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the \"willing,\"\n      as if the will would then remain over! In the third place, the will is not\n      only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION,\n      and in fact the emotion of the command. That which is termed \"freedom of\n      the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who\n      must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\"—this consciousness is\n      inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the\n      straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the\n      unconditional judgment that \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the\n      inward certainty that obedience will be rendered—and whatever else\n      pertains to the position of the commander. A man who WILLS commands\n      something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes\n      renders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about\n      the will,—this affair so extremely complex, for which the people\n      have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the\n      same time the commanding AND the obeying parties, and as the obeying party\n      we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and\n      motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch\n      as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to\n      deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term \"I\": a whole\n      series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about\n      the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing—to such a\n      degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.\n      Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when\n      the effect of the command—consequently obedience, and therefore\n      action—was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into\n      the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who\n      wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are\n      somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to\n      the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power\n      which accompanies all success. \"Freedom of Will\"—that is the\n      expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising\n      volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the\n      executor of the order—who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over\n      obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that\n      overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the\n      feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful\n      \"underwills\" or under-souls—indeed, our body is but a social\n      structure composed of many souls—to his feelings of delight as\n      commander. L'EFFET C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every\n      well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class\n      identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing\n      it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as\n      already said, of a social structure composed of many \"souls\", on which\n      account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such\n      within the sphere of morals—regarded as the doctrine of the\n      relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests\n      itself.", "20": " That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or\n      autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with\n      each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in\n      the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system\n      as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent—is betrayed in\n      the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers\n      always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE\n      philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in\n      the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves\n      with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them,\n      something impels them in definite order the one after the other—to\n      wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. Their\n      thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a\n      remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient\n      common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew:\n      philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The\n      wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German\n      philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is\n      affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar—I\n      mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar\n      grammatical functions—it cannot but be that everything is prepared\n      at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical\n      systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities\n      of world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within\n      the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the\n      subject is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be\n      found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and\n      Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also\n      the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.—So much\n      by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the origin of\n      ideas.", "21": " The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been\n      conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the\n      extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and\n      frightfully with this very folly. The desire for \"freedom of will\" in the\n      superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately,\n      in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and\n      ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the\n      world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less\n      than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than Munchausen\n      daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough\n      of nothingness. If any one should find out in this manner the crass\n      stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free will\" and put it out of\n      his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his \"enlightenment\" a step\n      further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous\n      conception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free will,\" which is tantamount to\n      a misuse of cause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE \"cause\"\n      and \"effect,\" as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them\n      naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical\n      doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it \"effects\" its\n      end; one should use \"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is\n      to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual\n      understanding,—NOT for explanation. In \"being-in-itself\" there is\n      nothing of \"casual-connection,\" of \"necessity,\" or of \"psychological\n      non-freedom\"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there \"law\" does\n      not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity,\n      relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and\n      when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as \"being-in-itself,\"\n      with things, we act once more as we have always acted—MYTHOLOGICALLY.\n      The \"non-free will\" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of\n      STRONG and WEAK wills.—It is almost always a symptom of what is\n      lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every \"causal-connection\" and\n      \"psychological necessity,\" manifests something of compulsion, indigence,\n      obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such\n      feelings—the person betrays himself. And in general, if I have\n      observed correctly, the \"non-freedom of the will\" is regarded as a problem\n      from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly\n      PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their \"responsibility,\" their\n      belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price\n      (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish\n      to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an\n      inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The\n      latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the\n      side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite\n      disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed\n      embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as \"la religion de la\n      souffrance humaine\"; that is ITS \"good taste.\"", "22": " Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from the\n      mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but\n      \"Nature's conformity to law,\" of which you physicists talk so proudly, as\n      though—why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad\n      \"philology.\" It is no matter of fact, no \"text,\" but rather just a naively\n      humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make\n      abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul!\n      \"Everywhere equality before the law—Nature is not different in that\n      respect, nor better than we\": a fine instance of secret motive, in which\n      the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic—likewise\n      a second and more refined atheism—is once more disguised. \"Ni dieu,\n      ni maitre\"—that, also, is what you want; and therefore \"Cheers for\n      natural law!\"—is it not so? But, as has been said, that is\n      interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with\n      opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the\n      same \"Nature,\" and with regard to the same phenomena, just the\n      tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of\n      power—an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and\n      unconditionalness of all \"Will to Power\" before your eyes, that almost\n      every word, and the word \"tyranny\" itself, would eventually seem\n      unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor—as being too\n      human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this\n      world as you do, namely, that it has a \"necessary\" and \"calculable\"\n      course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are\n      absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences\n      every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation—and you\n      will be eager enough to make this objection?—well, so much the\n      better.", "23": " All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and\n      timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far as\n      it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written,\n      evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if\n      nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and\n      DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power\n      of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual\n      world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has\n      obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting\n      manner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious\n      antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has \"the heart\" against it\n      even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the \"good\" and the\n      \"bad\" impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a\n      still strong and manly conscience—still more so, a doctrine of the\n      derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person\n      should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and\n      imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be\n      present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life\n      (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further\n      developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from\n      sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and\n      most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge,\n      and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep\n      away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted\n      hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly!\n      let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!

Not as its opposite, but—as its\n      refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere,\n      will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of\n      opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation;\n      it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which\n      now belongs to our unconquerable \"flesh and blood,\" will turn the words\n      round in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here and there we understand\n      it, and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most\n      to retain us in this SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined,\n      and suitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not,\n      it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life!", "25": " After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be\n      heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers\n      and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering \"for the\n      truth's sake\"! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence and\n      fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against\n      objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in\n      the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse\n      consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as\n      protectors of truth upon earth—as though \"the Truth\" were such an\n      innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all\n      people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and\n      Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that it\n      cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know that\n      hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might be a\n      more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you\n      place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and occasionally\n      after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games\n      before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way! Flee into\n      concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken\n      for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget the garden,\n      the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around you who are as\n      a garden—or as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day\n      becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome\n      solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense\n      whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make\n      one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force! How PERSONAL does a\n      long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies! These\n      pariahs of society, these long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones—also\n      the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos—always\n      become in the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and\n      perhaps without being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers\n      and poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and\n      theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is\n      the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour\n      has left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the\n      sake of truth,\" forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor\n      lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic\n      curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the\n      dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a\n      \"martyr,\" into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary\n      with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any case—merely\n      a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that\n      the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every philosophy has\n      been a long tragedy in its origin.", "26": " Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy,\n      where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority—where he may\n      forget \"men who are the rule,\" as their exception;—exclusive only of\n      the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger\n      instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in\n      intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and\n      grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess,\n      and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing,\n      however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust\n      upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said,\n      quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he\n      was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as such, he would\n      one day have to say to himself: \"The devil take my good taste! but 'the\n      rule' is more interesting than the exception—than myself, the\n      exception!\" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go \"inside.\" The\n      long and serious study of the AVERAGE man—and consequently much\n      disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all\n      intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's equals):—that\n      constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher;\n      perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is\n      fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will\n      meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I\n      mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the\n      commonplace and \"the rule\" in themselves, and at the same time have so\n      much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and\n      their like BEFORE WITNESSES—sometimes they wallow, even in books, as\n      on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls\n      approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to\n      all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown\n      becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.\n      There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust—namely,\n      where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such indiscreet\n      billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest,\n      acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man of his century—he was far\n      profounder than Voltaire, and consequently also, a good deal more silent.\n      It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is\n      placed on an ape's body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul,\n      an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral\n      physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather\n      quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with\n      one; whenever any one sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual\n      instinct, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in\n      short, when any one speaks \"badly\"—and not even \"ill\"—of man,\n      then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently;\n      he ought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk without\n      indignation. For the indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and\n      lacerates himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world,\n      God, or society), may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the\n      laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more\n      ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such\n      a LIAR as the indignant man.", "27": " It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives\n      gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among those only\n      who think and live otherwise—namely, kurmagati [Footnote: Like the\n      tortoise: lento.], or at best \"froglike,\" mandeikagati [Footnote: Like the\n      frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be \"difficultly understood\" myself!)—and\n      one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of\n      interpretation. As regards \"the good friends,\" however, who are always too\n      easy-going, and think that as friends they have a right to ease, one does\n      well at the very first to grant them a play-ground and romping-place for\n      misunderstanding—one can thus laugh still; or get rid of them\n      altogether, these good friends—and laugh then also!", "28": " What is most difficult to render from one language into another is the\n      TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the race, or\n      to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the assimilation of\n      its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations, which, as\n      involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original,\n      merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates\n      all dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A German\n      is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language; consequently also, as\n      may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most delightful and daring\n      NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just as the buffoon and satyr\n      are foreign to him in body and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius\n      are untranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and pompously\n      clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style, are developed in\n      profuse variety among Germans—pardon me for stating the fact that\n      even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of stiffness and elegance, is no\n      exception, as a reflection of the \"good old time\" to which it belongs, and\n      as an expression of German taste at a time when there was still a \"German\n      taste,\" which was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an\n      exception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was\n      versed in many things; he who was not the translator of Bayle to no\n      purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire,\n      and still more willingly among the Roman comedy-writers—Lessing\n      loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO, and flight out of Germany. But how\n      could the German language, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO\n      of Machiavelli, who in his \"Principe\" makes us breathe the dry, fine air\n      of Florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a\n      boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of\n      the contrast he ventures to present—long, heavy, difficult,\n      dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest\n      humour? Finally, who would venture on a German translation of Petronius,\n      who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in\n      invention, ideas, and words? What matter in the end about the swamps of\n      the sick, evil world, or of the \"ancient world,\" when like him, one has\n      the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a\n      wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with\n      regard to Aristophanes—that transfiguring, complementary genius, for\n      whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has\n      understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and\n      transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on\n      PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit\n      fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no \"Bible,\"\n      nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic—but a book of\n      Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life—a Greek life\n      which he repudiated—without an Aristophanes!", "29": " It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a\n      privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best\n      right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not\n      only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth,\n      he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already\n      brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and\n      where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some\n      minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far\n      from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize\n      with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to\n      the sympathy of men!", "30": " Our deepest insights must—and should—appear as follies,\n      and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly\n      to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The\n      exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by\n      philosophers—among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and\n      Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and\n      NOT in equality and equal rights—are not so much in\n      contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class,\n      standing without, and viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the\n      outside, and not from the inside; the more essential distinction is that\n      the class in question views things from below upwards—while the\n      esoteric class views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the\n      soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically;\n      and if all the woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to\n      decide whether the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to\n      sympathy, and thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the\n      higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison\n      to an entirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of\n      the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it\n      might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate\n      and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which\n      he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he\n      had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the\n      health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the\n      higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are\n      dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are\n      herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the\n      general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people\n      clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they\n      reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if\n      one wishes to breathe PURE air.", "31": " In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of\n      NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard\n      penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay. Everything\n      is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR THE\n      UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns to\n      introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions\n      with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The angry and\n      reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until\n      it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion\n      upon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and deceptive.\n      Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally\n      turns suspiciously against itself—still ardent and savage even in\n      its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how\n      impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long\n      self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary blindness! In this\n      transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments; one\n      tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience\n      to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more\n      refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon principle the cause\n      AGAINST \"youth.\"—A decade later, and one comprehends that all this\n      was also still—youth!", "32": " Throughout the longest period of human history—one calls it the\n      prehistoric period—the value or non-value of an action was inferred\n      from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into\n      consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at\n      present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its\n      parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what induced\n      men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period the\n      PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, \"Know thyself!\" was then\n      still unknown.—In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on\n      certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that\n      one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide\n      with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important\n      refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the\n      supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in \"origin,\" the mark\n      of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL\n      one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the\n      consequences, the origin—what an inversion of perspective! And\n      assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering! To\n      be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar narrowness of\n      interpretation, attained supremacy precisely thereby: the origin of an\n      action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible, as origin out\n      of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the belief that the value of an\n      action lay in the value of its intention. The intention as the sole origin\n      and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice\n      moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even\n      philosophized almost up to the present day.—Is it not possible,\n      however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our\n      minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values,\n      owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man—is it not\n      possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to\n      begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays\n      when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the\n      decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT\n      INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible,\n      or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface or skin—which, like every\n      skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more? In short, we believe\n      that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an\n      explanation—a sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations,\n      and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the\n      sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has\n      been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably\n      something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case\n      something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a\n      certain sense even the self-mounting of morality—let that be the\n      name for the long-secret labour which has been reserved for the most\n      refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today,\n      as the living touchstones of the soul.", "33": " It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for\n      one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly\n      called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of\n      \"disinterested contemplation,\" under which the emasculation of art\n      nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.\n      There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments \"for others\"\n      and \"NOT for myself,\" for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,\n      and for one asking promptly: \"Are they not perhaps—DECEPTIONS?\"—That\n      they PLEASE—him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and\n      also the mere spectator—that is still no argument in their FAVOUR,\n      but just calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!", "34": " At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,\n      seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we think\n      we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we\n      find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises\n      concerning a deceptive principle in the \"nature of things.\" He, however,\n      who makes thinking itself, and consequently \"the spirit,\" responsible for\n      the falseness of the world—an honourable exit, which every conscious\n      or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of—he who regards this\n      world, including space, time, form, and movement, as falsely DEDUCED,\n      would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of\n      all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy\n      tricks? and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do\n      what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of\n      thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even\n      nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it\n      will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be \"real\" or not,\n      and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other\n      questions of the same description. The belief in \"immediate certainties\"\n      is a MORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; but—we have\n      now to cease being \"MERELY moral\" men! Apart from morality, such belief is\n      a folly which does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an\n      ever-ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a \"bad character,\" and\n      consequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class\n      world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and\n      saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to \"bad character,\" as the\n      being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth—he is now under\n      OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every\n      abyss of suspicion.—Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and\n      turn of expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and\n      estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I\n      keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with\n      which philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing\n      more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it\n      is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be\n      conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of\n      perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm\n      and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with\n      the \"seeming world\"—well, granted that YOU could do that,—at\n      least nothing of your \"truth\" would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it\n      that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential\n      opposition of \"true\" and \"false\"? Is it not enough to suppose degrees of\n      seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of\n      semblance—different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might not the\n      world WHICH CONCERNS US—be a fiction? And to any one who suggested:\n      \"But to a fiction belongs an originator?\"—might it not be bluntly\n      replied: WHY? May not this \"belong\" also belong to the fiction? Is it not\n      at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as\n      towards the predicate and object? Might not the philosopher elevate\n      himself above faith in grammar? All respect to governesses, but is it not\n      time that philosophy should renounce governess-faith?", "35": " O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in \"the\n      truth,\" and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it too\n      humanely—\"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien\"—I\n      wager he finds nothing!", "36": " Supposing that nothing else is \"given\" as real but our world of\n      desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other \"reality\"\n      but just that of our impulses—for thinking is only a relation of\n      these impulses to one another:—are we not permitted to make the\n      attempt and to ask the question whether this which is \"given\" does not\n      SUFFICE, by means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the\n      so-called mechanical (or \"material\") world? I do not mean as an illusion,\n      a \"semblance,\" a \"representation\" (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian\n      sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions\n      themselves—as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in\n      which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards\n      branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also,\n      refines and debilitates)—as a kind of instinctive life in which all\n      organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition,\n      secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with one\n      another—as a PRIMARY FORM of life?—In the end, it is not only\n      permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of\n      LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the\n      attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest\n      extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is a morality\n      of method which one may not repudiate nowadays—it follows \"from its\n      definition,\" as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately whether we\n      really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in the\n      causality of the will; if we do so—and fundamentally our belief IN\n      THIS is just our belief in causality itself—we MUST make the attempt\n      to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.\n      \"Will\" can naturally only operate on \"will\"—and not on \"matter\" (not\n      on \"nerves,\" for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded,\n      whether will does not operate on will wherever \"effects\" are recognized—and\n      whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is\n      not just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we\n      succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and\n      ramification of one fundamental form of will—namely, the Will to\n      Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be\n      traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution of the problem of\n      generation and nutrition—it is one problem—could also be found\n      therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define ALL active force\n      unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The world seen from within, the world\n      defined and designated according to its \"intelligible character\"—it\n      would simply be \"Will to Power,\" and nothing else.", "37": " \"What?

This latter\n      doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among\n      savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive\n      sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential\n      paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both symptoms\n      perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it MORE\n      obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown\n      such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to have\n      been more interesting to men and even to philosophers—perhaps it is\n      time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,\n      better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY—Yet in the background of the\n      most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the\n      problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious\n      crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the\n      saint possible?—that seems to have been the very question with which\n      Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher.

The hitherto existing\n      psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have\n      happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the\n      dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral values,\n      and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the text and facts\n      of the case?

There is a\n      feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously\n      longs for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In\n      many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's or\n      youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also\n      as her last ambition.

One stands with fear and\n      reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and\n      one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula\n      Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the\n      \"Progress of Mankind.\" To be sure, he who is himself only a slender, tame\n      house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like our\n      cultured people of today, including the Christians of \"cultured\"\n      Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins—the\n      taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to \"great\" and\n      \"small\": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,\n      still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the\n      genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound up\n      this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with\n      the Old Testament into one book, as the \"Bible,\" as \"The Book in Itself,\"\n      is perhaps the greatest audacity and \"sin against the Spirit\" which\n      literary Europe has upon its conscience.", "53": " Why Atheism nowadays? \"The father\" in God is thoroughly refuted;\n      equally so \"the judge,\" \"the rewarder.\" Also his \"free will\": he does not\n      hear—and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst is\n      that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?—This\n      is what I have made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of\n      conversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism; it\n      appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth,—it\n      rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust.", "54": " What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes—and\n      indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure—an\n      ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old\n      conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and\n      predicate conception—that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental\n      presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as\n      epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although\n      (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in\n      effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in grammar and the\n      grammatical subject: one said, \"I\" is the condition, \"think\" is the\n      predicate and is conditioned—to think is an activity for which one\n      MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made, with marvelous\n      tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,—to\n      see if the opposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the condition, and \"I\"\n      the conditioned; \"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by\n      thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the\n      subject, the subject could not be proved—nor the object either: the\n      possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and therefore of \"the\n      soul,\" may not always have been strange to him,—the thought which\n      once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta philosophy.", "55": " There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but\n      three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed human\n      beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the best—to\n      this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions,\n      and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the\n      Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then,\n      during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the\n      strongest instincts they possessed, their \"nature\"; THIS festal joy shines\n      in the cruel glances of ascetics and \"anti-natural\" fanatics. Finally,\n      what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it not necessary in the end for\n      men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith\n      in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not\n      necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to\n      worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for\n      nothingness—this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has\n      been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof\n      already.", "56": " Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long\n      endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it\n      from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which it\n      has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of\n      Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye,\n      has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all\n      possible modes of thought—beyond good and evil, and no longer like\n      Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of morality,—whoever\n      has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without really desiring it,\n      opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most\n      world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has not only learnt to\n      compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it\n      again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity, insatiably calling out da capo,\n      not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and not only the\n      play, but actually to him who requires the play—and makes it\n      necessary; because he always requires himself anew—and makes himself\n      necessary.—What? And this would not be—circulus vitiosus deus?", "57": " The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the\n      strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes\n      profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into view.\n      Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its\n      acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise,\n      something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps\n      the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and\n      suffering, the conceptions \"God\" and \"sin,\" will one day seem to us of no\n      more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to an old\n      man;—and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be\n      necessary once more for \"the old man\"—always childish enough, an\n      eternal child!", "58": " Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or\n      semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its\n      favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft\n      placidity called \"prayer,\" the state of perpetual readiness for the\n      \"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness\n      of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work\n      is DISHONOURING—that it vulgarizes body and soul—is not quite\n      unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing,\n      conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for\n      \"unbelief\" more than anything else? Among these, for instance, who are at\n      present living apart from religion in Germany, I find \"free-thinkers\" of\n      diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom\n      laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious\n      instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and\n      only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment.\n      They feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by\n      their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the \"Fatherland,\" and\n      the newspapers, and their \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time\n      whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them\n      whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure—for it\n      is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church\n      merely to spoil their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious\n      customs; should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require\n      their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many\n      things are done—with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and\n      without much curiosity or discomfort;—they live too much apart and\n      outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters.\n      Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of\n      German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great\n      laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious\n      scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of the\n      theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives\n      psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of pious,\n      or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW MUCH\n      good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German\n      scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession\n      (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is\n      compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost\n      charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally\n      mingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit which he takes\n      for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church. It\n      is only with the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience,\n      therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful\n      seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions;\n      but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards\n      them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still\n      maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. The\n      practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has\n      been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into\n      circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and\n      things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which\n      prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings\n      with it.—Every age has its own divine type of naivete, for the\n      discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naivete—adorable,\n      childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of\n      the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance,\n      in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the\n      religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE\n      which he himself has developed—he, the little arrogant dwarf and\n      mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of \"modern\n      ideas\"!", "59": " Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what\n      wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their\n      preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and\n      false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of\n      \"pure forms\" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be\n      doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that\n      extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.\n      Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt\n      children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying\n      to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might\n      guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they\n      wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified,—one\n      might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their HIGHEST\n      rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which\n      compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious\n      interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that\n      truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough,\n      hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the \"Life in God,\" regarded in this\n      light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR\n      of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the\n      most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth,\n      to untruth at any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective\n      means of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so\n      artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no\n      longer offends.", "60": " To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE—this has so far been the noblest\n      and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to\n      mankind, without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an\n      ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has\n      first to get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling\n      of ambergris from a higher inclination—whoever first perceived and\n      \"experienced\" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted\n      to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and\n      respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the\n      finest fashion!", "61": " The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him—as the man of\n      the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general\n      development of mankind,—will use religion for his disciplining and\n      educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and\n      economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining influence—destructive,\n      as well as creative and fashioning—which can be exercised by means\n      of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed\n      under its spell and protection. For those who are strong and independent,\n      destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a\n      ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for\n      overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority—as a bond which\n      binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the\n      former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain\n      escape obedience. And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin,\n      if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more\n      retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more\n      refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an\n      order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from\n      the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing\n      immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all political agitation. The\n      Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With the help of a religious\n      organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for\n      the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and\n      outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the same time\n      religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to\n      qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending\n      ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs,\n      volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase. To them\n      religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher\n      intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative\n      self-control, of silence, and of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are\n      almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks\n      to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future\n      supremacy. And finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people,\n      who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to\n      exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and\n      condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social\n      happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and\n      embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all\n      the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion,\n      together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such\n      perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to\n      them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates\n      upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,\n      almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and\n      vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and\n      Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by\n      piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their\n      satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough\n      to live—this very difficulty being necessary.", "62": " To be sure—to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such\n      religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers—the cost is\n      always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an\n      educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but\n      rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end, and\n      not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other animals,\n      there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and\n      necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also,\n      are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE ANIMAL\n      NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare exception. But worse\n      still. The higher the type a man represents, the greater is the\n      improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the law of\n      irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself\n      most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the\n      conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to\n      determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions\n      above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to\n      preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the\n      religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they\n      are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and\n      they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and\n      impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative\n      care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also\n      to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto\n      PARAMOUNT religions—to give a general appreciation of them—are\n      among the principal causes which have kept the type of \"man\" upon a lower\n      level—they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED.\n      One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently\n      rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the\n      \"spiritual men\" of Christianity have done for Europe hitherto! But when\n      they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and\n      despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured\n      from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted\n      and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically\n      in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all\n      the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the\n      DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value—THAT\n      is what they had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes,\n      to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything\n      autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious—all instincts which are\n      natural to the highest and most successful type of \"man\"—into\n      uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to\n      invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into\n      hatred of the earth and earthly things—THAT is the task the Church\n      imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its\n      standard of value, \"unworldliness,\" \"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\"\n      fused into one sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful,\n      equally coarse and refined comedy of European Christianity with the\n      derisive and impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would\n      never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some\n      single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make\n      a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements\n      (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could\n      approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as\n      exemplified in the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not\n      have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: \"Oh, you bunglers,\n      presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for\n      your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you\n      presumed to do!\"—I should say that Christianity has hitherto been\n      the most portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard\n      enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not\n      sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime\n      self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and\n      perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically\n      different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:—SUCH\n      men, with their \"equality before God,\" have hitherto swayed the destiny of\n      Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been\n      produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the\n      European of the present day.", "63": " He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously—and even\n      himself—only in relation to his pupils.", "64": " \"Knowledge for its own sake\"—that is the last snare laid by\n      morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.", "65": " The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has\n      to be overcome on the way to it.65A", "66": " The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,\n      deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.", "67": " Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of\n      all others.

Indeed, the expression, \"Science of Morals\" is,\n      in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter\n      to GOOD taste,—which is always a foretaste of more modest\n      expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still\n      necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present:\n      namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and\n      classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and\n      distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish—and\n      perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common\n      forms of these living crystallizations—as preparation for a THEORY\n      OF TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.\n      All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded\n      of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and\n      ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:\n      they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality—and every philosopher\n      hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself,\n      however, has been regarded as something \"given.\" How far from their\n      awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem—left in dust\n      and decay—of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding\n      that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It\n      was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts\n      imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement—perhaps\n      as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their\n      Zeitgeist, their climate and zone—it was precisely because they were\n      badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by\n      no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in\n      sight of the real problems of morals—problems which only disclose\n      themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every \"Science of\n      Morals\" hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself\n      has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything\n      problematic there! That which philosophers called \"giving a basis to\n      morality,\" and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,\n      proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new\n      means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the\n      sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of\n      denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question—and\n      in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and\n      vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence—almost\n      worthy of honour—Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your\n      conclusions concerning the scientificness of a \"Science\" whose latest\n      master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: \"The\n      principle,\" he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote:\n      Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B.\n      Bullock, M.A. (1903).] \"the axiom about the purport of which all moralists\n      are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva—is\n      REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ...\n      the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's\n      stone, for centuries.\"—The difficulty of establishing the\n      proposition referred to may indeed be great—it is well known that\n      Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has\n      thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition\n      is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that\n      Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLY—played the flute...\n      daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A\n      question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world,\n      who MAKES A HALT at morality—who assents to morality, and plays the\n      flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really—a pessimist?", "187": " Apart from the value of such assertions as \"there is a categorical\n      imperative in us,\" one can always ask: What does such an assertion\n      indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are\n      meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems\n      of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with\n      other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he\n      wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to\n      glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,—this system of\n      morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of\n      him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative\n      arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives\n      us to understand by his morals that \"what is estimable in me, is that I\n      know how to obey—and with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with\n      me!\" In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.", "188": " In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of\n      tyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however, no\n      objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that\n      all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential\n      and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint.\n      In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should\n      remember the constraint under which every language has attained to\n      strength and freedom—the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme\n      and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation\n      given themselves!—not excepting some of the prose writers of today,\n      in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness—\"for the sake of\n      a folly,\" as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise—\"from\n      submission to arbitrary laws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy\n      themselves \"free,\" even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however,\n      that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and\n      masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought\n      itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just\n      as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such\n      arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that\n      precisely this is \"nature\" and \"natural\"—and not laisser-aller!\n      Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is\n      his \"most natural\" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and\n      constructing in the moments of \"inspiration\"—and how strictly and\n      delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness\n      and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most\n      stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,\n      and ambiguous in it). The essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is,\n      apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE\n      in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in\n      the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,\n      virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality—anything whatever\n      that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of\n      the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas,\n      the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance\n      with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian\n      premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that\n      happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to\n      rediscover and justify the Christian God:—all this violence,\n      arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved\n      itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its\n      strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that\n      much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and\n      spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, \"nature\" shows herself as\n      she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is\n      shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries European thinkers\n      only thought in order to prove something—nowadays, on the contrary,\n      we are suspicious of every thinker who \"wishes to prove something\"—that\n      it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their\n      strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former\n      times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent,\n      Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events \"for the glory of\n      God,\" or \"for the good of the soul\":—this tyranny, this\n      arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit;\n      slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an\n      indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. One may\n      look at every system of morals in this light: it is \"nature\" therein which\n      teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the\n      need for limited horizons, for immediate duties—it teaches the\n      NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is\n      a condition of life and development. \"Thou must obey some one, and for a\n      long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for\n      thyself\"—this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature,\n      which is certainly neither \"categorical,\" as old Kant wished (consequently\n      the \"otherwise\"), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does\n      nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks;\n      above all, however, to the animal \"man\" generally, to MANKIND.", "189": " Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a\n      master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an\n      extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week—and\n      work-day again:—as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated\n      FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as\n      is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work).\n      Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and\n      habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are\n      appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew.\n      Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they\n      show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those\n      intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse\n      learns to humble and submit itself—at the same time also to PURIFY\n      and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a\n      similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic\n      culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal\n      odours).—Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why\n      it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in\n      general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual\n      impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).", "190": " There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really\n      belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say,\n      in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble.\n      \"No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The\n      evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he\n      knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through\n      error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him—good.\"—This\n      mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the\n      unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that \"it is\n      STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept \"good\" as identical with \"useful\n      and pleasant,\" without further thought. As regards every system of\n      utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and\n      follow the scent: one will seldom err.—Plato did all he could to\n      interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and\n      above all to interpret himself into them—he, the most daring of all\n      interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a\n      popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible\n      modifications—namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities.\n      In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates,\n      if not—[Greek words inserted here.]", "191": " The old theological problem of \"Faith\" and \"Knowledge,\" or more\n      plainly, of instinct and reason—the question whether, in respect to\n      the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than\n      rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives,\n      according to a \"Why,\" that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility—it\n      is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of\n      Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates\n      himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent—that of a\n      surpassing dialectician—took first the side of reason; and, in fact,\n      what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the\n      noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could\n      never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?\n      In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at\n      himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself\n      the same difficulty and incapacity. \"But why\"—he said to himself—\"should\n      one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them\n      right, and the reason ALSO—one must follow the instincts, but at the\n      same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments.\" This\n      was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought\n      his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of\n      self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral\n      judgment.—Plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the\n      craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure\n      of all his strength—the greatest strength a philosopher had ever\n      expended—that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to\n      the good, to \"God\"; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have\n      followed the same path—which means that in matters of morality,\n      instinct (or as Christians call it, \"Faith,\" or as I call it, \"the herd\")\n      has hitherto triumphed. Unless one should make an exception in the case of\n      Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of\n      the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason\n      is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial.", "192": " Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its\n      development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest\n      processes of all \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the premature\n      hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to \"belief,\" and the lack\n      of distrust and patience are first developed—our senses learn late,\n      and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of\n      knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a\n      picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and\n      novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more \"morality.\"\n      It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear\n      strange music badly. When we hear another language spoken, we\n      involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more\n      familiar and conversant—it was thus, for example, that the Germans\n      modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses\n      are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the\n      \"simplest\" processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE—such as\n      fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.—As little\n      as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of\n      syllables) of a page—he rather takes about five out of every twenty\n      words at random, and \"guesses\" the probably appropriate sense to them—just\n      as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its\n      leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy\n      the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the most remarkable\n      experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of\n      the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as\n      \"inventors\" thereof. All this goes to prove that from our fundamental\n      nature and from remote ages we have been—ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to\n      express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly—one\n      is much more of an artist than one is aware of.—In an animated\n      conversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am speaking\n      so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to the thought he\n      expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of\n      distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of my visual faculty—the\n      delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes MUST\n      therefore be imagined by me. Probably the person put on quite a different\n      expression, or none at all.", "193": " Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we\n      experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last\n      just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything \"actually\"\n      experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a\n      requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the\n      brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the\n      nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his\n      dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the\n      power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable\n      happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he\n      can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a\n      certain divine levity, an \"upwards\" without effort or constraint, a\n      \"downwards\" without descending or lowering—without TROUBLE!—how\n      could the man with such dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find\n      \"happiness\" differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours!\n      How could he fail—to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? \"Flight,\" such\n      as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own \"flying,\" be\n      far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too \"troublesome\" for him.", "194": " The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the\n      difference of their lists of desirable things—in their regarding\n      different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the\n      greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized\n      desirable things:—it manifests itself much more in what they regard\n      as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,\n      for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification\n      serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more\n      modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for\n      possession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such\n      ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially\n      whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his\n      sake what she has or would like to have—only THEN does he look upon\n      her as \"possessed.\" A third, however, has not even here got to the limit\n      of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the\n      woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a\n      phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well\n      known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found\n      out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when\n      she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much\n      for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his\n      goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a\n      nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina\n      suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for\n      possession, says to himself: \"One may not deceive where one desires to\n      possess\"—he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of\n      him should rule in the hearts of the people: \"I must, therefore, MAKE\n      myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!\" Among helpful and\n      charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which\n      first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance,\n      he should \"merit\" help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself\n      deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With\n      these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in\n      general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One\n      finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity.\n      Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children—they\n      call that \"education\"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that\n      the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about\n      his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times\n      fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or\n      death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the\n      father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince\n      still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new\n      possession. The consequence is...", "195": " The Jews—a people \"born for slavery,\" as Tacitus and the whole\n      ancient world say of them; \"the chosen people among the nations,\" as they\n      themselves say and believe—the Jews performed the miracle of the\n      inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new\n      and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused into\n      one the expressions \"rich,\" \"godless,\" \"wicked,\" \"violent,\" \"sensual,\" and\n      for the first time coined the word \"world\" as a term of reproach. In this\n      inversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the word\n      \"poor\" as synonymous with \"saint\" and \"friend\") the significance of the\n      Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that the SLAVE-INSURRECTION\n      IN MORALS commences.", "196": " It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the\n      sun—such as we shall never see.

This need tries to satisfy itself\n      and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength,\n      impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite\n      with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all\n      sorts of commanders—parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or\n      public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human development, the\n      hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof,\n      is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is\n      transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine\n      this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and\n      independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will\n      suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception\n      on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if\n      they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in\n      Europe at present—I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding\n      class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad\n      conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher\n      orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or\n      of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the\n      current opinions of the herd, as \"first servants of their people,\" or\n      \"instruments of the public weal\". On the other hand, the gregarious\n      European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man\n      that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit,\n      kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy,\n      by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the\n      peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where it is believed that the\n      leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is\n      made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever\n      gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this\n      origin. In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight\n      becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these\n      gregarious Europeans—of this fact the effect of the appearance of\n      Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon\n      is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century\n      has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods.", "200": " The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one\n      another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body—that\n      is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards\n      of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace—such\n      a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak\n      man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to\n      an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine\n      and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above\n      all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of\n      final unity—it is the \"Sabbath of Sabbaths,\" to use the expression\n      of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.—Should,\n      however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an\n      ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to life—and if, on the other hand,\n      in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also\n      inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for\n      carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of\n      self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously\n      incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men,\n      predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples\n      of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate\n      the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick\n      the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear\n      precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for\n      repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other,\n      and spring from the same causes.", "201": " As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only\n      gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only\n      kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what\n      seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no\n      \"morality of love to one's neighbour.\" Granted even that there is already\n      a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,\n      gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of\n      society all those instincts are already active which are latterly\n      distinguished by honourable names as \"virtues,\" and eventually almost\n      coincide with the conception \"morality\": in that period they do not as yet\n      belong to the domain of moral valuations—they are still ULTRA-MORAL.\n      A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral\n      nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a\n      sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the\n      best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which\n      contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all,\n      \"love to our neighbour\" is always a secondary matter, partly conventional\n      and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After\n      the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against\n      external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new\n      perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts,\n      such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness,\n      rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be\n      honoured from the point of view of general utility—under other\n      names, of course, than those here given—but had to be fostered and\n      cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger\n      against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be\n      doubly strong—when the outlets for them are lacking—and are\n      gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary\n      instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious\n      instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little\n      dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion,\n      a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment—that is now\n      the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by\n      the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and\n      carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level\n      of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is\n      destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks,\n      consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The\n      lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the\n      cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the\n      individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is\n      henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting,\n      self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral\n      distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there\n      is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to\n      severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice,\n      begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and\n      self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\" and\n      still more \"the sheep,\" wins respect. There is a point of diseased\n      mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society\n      itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and\n      does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be\n      somehow unfair—it is certain that the idea of \"punishment\" and \"the\n      obligation to punish\" are then painful and alarming to people. \"Is it not\n      sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still\n      punish? Punishment itself is terrible!\"—with these questions\n      gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion.\n      If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have\n      done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be\n      necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!—Whoever\n      examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit\n      the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the\n      imperative of the timidity of the herd \"we wish that some time or other\n      there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!\" Some time or other—the will and\n      the way THERETO is nowadays called \"progress\" all over Europe.", "202": " Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times,\n      for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths—OUR\n      truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly,\n      and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be\n      accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of\n      \"modern ideas\" that we have constantly applied the terms \"herd,\"\n      \"herd-instincts,\" and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot\n      do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We have\n      found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become\n      unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence\n      prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not\n      know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach—they\n      \"know\" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be\n      distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks\n      it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and\n      calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the\n      instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to\n      preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the\n      increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the\n      symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and\n      therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality,\n      beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and\n      above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a\n      \"possibility,\" against such a \"should be,\" however, this morality defends\n      itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably \"I am\n      morality itself and nothing else is morality!\" Indeed, with the help of a\n      religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the\n      herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a\n      more visible expression of this morality even in political and social\n      arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian\n      movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the\n      more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the\n      herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and\n      always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now\n      roving through the highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition\n      to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and\n      still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries\n      who call themselves Socialists and want a \"free society,\" those are really\n      at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every\n      form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even\n      of repudiating the notions \"master\" and \"servant\"—ni dieu ni maitre,\n      says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every\n      special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately\n      opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs \"rights\"\n      any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it\n      were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all\n      former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in\n      their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very\n      animals, up even to \"God\"—the extravagance of \"sympathy for God\"\n      belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience\n      of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their\n      almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING it; at one in\n      their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which\n      Europe seems to be threatened with a new Buddhism; at one in their belief\n      in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as though it were morality in itself,\n      the climax, the ATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future,\n      the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the\n      obligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the\n      community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in \"themselves.\"", "203": " We, who hold a different belief—we, who regard the democratic\n      movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but\n      as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his\n      mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In NEW\n      PHILOSOPHERS—there is no other alternative: in minds strong and\n      original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and\n      invert \"eternal valuations\"; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in\n      the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will\n      compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of humanity\n      as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast\n      hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in\n      order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance\n      which has hitherto gone by the name of \"history\" (the folly of the\n      \"greatest number\" is only its last form)—for that purpose a new type\n      of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the\n      very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult,\n      terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The image of\n      such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:—is it lawful for me to say it\n      aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one would partly have to\n      create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and\n      tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and\n      power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values,\n      under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled\n      and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such\n      responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the\n      dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:—these\n      are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these\n      are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of\n      OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or\n      experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated;\n      but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of \"man\" himself\n      DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary\n      fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future\n      of mankind—a game in which neither the hand, nor even a \"finger of\n      God\" has participated!—he who divines the fate that is hidden under\n      the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of \"modern ideas,\" and still\n      more under the whole of Christo-European morality—suffers from an\n      anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all\n      that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and\n      augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the\n      knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest\n      possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in\n      presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:—he knows still\n      better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles\n      promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to\n      pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL\n      DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the \"man of the future\"—as\n      idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates—this degeneracy\n      and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call\n      it, to a man of \"free society\"), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with\n      equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out\n      this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown\n      to the rest of mankind—and perhaps also a new MISSION!", "204": " At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which\n      it has always been—namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according\n      to Balzac—I would venture to protest against an improper and\n      injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the\n      best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations\n      of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right out\n      of one's own EXPERIENCE—experience, as it seems to me, always\n      implies unfortunate experience?—to treat of such an important\n      question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST\n      science like women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!\" sigh their\n      instinct and their shame, \"it always FINDS THINGS OUT!\"). The declaration\n      of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,\n      is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and\n      disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the\n      learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime—which\n      does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here\n      also the instinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom from all masters!\" and\n      after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose\n      \"hand-maid\" it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and\n      indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the\n      \"master\"—what am I saying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own\n      account. My memory—the memory of a scientific man, if you please!—teems\n      with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and\n      philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the\n      most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and\n      schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). On one\n      occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood\n      on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another\n      time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and\n      refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt\n      himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the\n      colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a\n      series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which \"does\n      nobody any good\". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of\n      the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time\n      the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended\n      to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most frequently,\n      behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil\n      after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole\n      obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful\n      estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of—the result\n      being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for\n      instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by\n      his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the\n      whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German\n      culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a\n      divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point\n      Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of\n      ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been\n      the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in\n      short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the\n      reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the\n      populace. Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world\n      diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato,\n      Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of\n      the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY\n      feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such\n      representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present\n      day, are just as much aloft as they are down below—in Germany, for\n      instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the\n      amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the sight of those\n      hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves \"realists,\" or\n      \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the\n      soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are\n      themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident! All of them\n      are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the\n      dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from\n      themselves, without having a right to the \"more\" and its responsibility—and\n      who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and\n      deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all,\n      how could it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good\n      conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the\n      entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of\n      the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity\n      Philosophy reduced to a \"theory of knowledge,\" no more in fact than a\n      diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that\n      never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the\n      right to enter—that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an\n      agony, something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy—RULE!", "205": " The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact,\n      so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still\n      come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have\n      increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the\n      philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself\n      somewhere and \"specialize\" so that he will no longer attain to his\n      elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and\n      his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity\n      and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated,\n      so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much\n      importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual\n      conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the\n      temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows\n      too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer\n      commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great\n      play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher—in\n      short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if\n      it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the\n      philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from\n      himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning\n      life and the worth of life—he learns unwillingly to believe that it\n      is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek\n      his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive\n      (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating,\n      doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken\n      and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal\n      scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized\n      visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody\n      praised, because he lives \"wisely,\" or \"as a philosopher,\" it hardly means\n      anything more than \"prudently and apart.\" Wisdom: that seems to the\n      populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing\n      successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher—does it\n      not seem so to US, my friends?—lives \"unphilosophically\" and\n      \"unwisely,\" above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of\n      a hundred attempts and temptations of life—he risks HIMSELF\n      constantly, he plays THIS bad game.", "206": " In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either\n      ENGENDERS or PRODUCES—both words understood in their fullest sense—the\n      man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the\n      old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two\n      principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and to the\n      old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnification—in\n      these cases one emphasizes the respectability—and yet, in the\n      compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let\n      us examine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a\n      commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a\n      non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he\n      possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and\n      moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people\n      like himself, and for that which they require—for instance: the\n      portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest\n      from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and\n      foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a\n      good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with\n      which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all\n      dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome.\n      The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an\n      ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak\n      points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. He is\n      confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and\n      precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and\n      more reserved—his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake,\n      which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most\n      dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of\n      mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours\n      instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours\n      to break—or still better, to relax—every bent bow To relax, of\n      course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent hand—to\n      RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has\n      always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.", "207": " However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit—and who\n      has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded\n      IPSISIMOSITY!—in the end, however, one must learn caution even with\n      regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which\n      the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been\n      celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and\n      glorification—as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist\n      school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest\n      honours to \"disinterested knowledge\" The objective man, who no longer\n      curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom\n      the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and\n      partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that\n      exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful He is only\n      an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR—he is no \"purpose in\n      himself\" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration\n      before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as\n      knowing or \"reflecting\" implies—he waits until something comes, and\n      then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and\n      gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film\n      Whatever \"personality\" he still possesses seems to him accidental,\n      arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard\n      himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls\n      up the recollection of \"himself\" with an effort, and not infrequently\n      wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes\n      mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and\n      negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and\n      confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and\n      society—indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in\n      vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and\n      tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He\n      does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is\n      serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping\n      and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all\n      objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which\n      he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate\n      good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are\n      enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his!—and\n      as man generally, he becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such\n      virtues. Should one wish love or hatred from him—I mean love and\n      hatred as God, woman, and animal understand them—he will do what he\n      can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should\n      not be much—if he should show himself just at this point to be\n      false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained,\n      his hatred is artificial, and rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight\n      ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be\n      objective; only in his serene totality is he still \"nature\" and \"natural.\"\n      His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to\n      affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he\n      destroy. \"JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN\"—he says, with Leibniz: let us\n      not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he\n      does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself\n      generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either\n      good or evil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with\n      the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too\n      much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlooked—he\n      is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest\n      sort of slave, but nothing in himself—PRESQUE RIEN! The objective\n      man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring\n      instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and\n      respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary\n      man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination—and\n      still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing\n      hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a\n      soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some\n      kind of content and frame to \"shape\" itself thereto—for the most\n      part a man without frame and content, a \"selfless\" man. Consequently,\n      also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI.", "208": " When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic—I\n      hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the\n      objective spirit?—people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on\n      that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many\n      questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he\n      is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of skepticism, it\n      seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the\n      distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a\n      dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a\n      pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, but—dreadful\n      thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of \"good-will\"—a will\n      to the veritable, actual negation of life—there is, as is generally\n      acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism,\n      the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now\n      prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the \"spirit,\" and\n      its underground noises. \"Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?\" say\n      the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police;\n      \"this subterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!\" The\n      skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened;\n      his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that\n      sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!—they\n      seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a\n      festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with\n      Montaigne: \"What do I know?\" Or with Socrates: \"I know that I know\n      nothing.\" Or: \"Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me.\" Or:\n      \"Even if the door were open, why should I enter immediately?\" Or: \"What is\n      the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to\n      make no hypotheses at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at\n      once what is crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is\n      there not time enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons,\n      can ye not at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx,\n      too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.\"—Thus does a\n      skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For\n      skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided\n      physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous\n      debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have\n      been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In\n      the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and\n      valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and\n      tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues\n      prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and\n      perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however, which\n      is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they\n      are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous\n      feeling of pleasure in willing—they are doubtful of the \"freedom of\n      the will\" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a\n      senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and\n      CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and\n      depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs\n      impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy\n      aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs—and often\n      sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not find this\n      cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How seductively\n      ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this\n      disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in\n      the show-cases as \"objectiveness,\" \"the scientific spirit,\" \"L'ART POUR\n      L'ART,\" and \"pure voluntary knowledge,\" is only decked-out skepticism and\n      paralysis of will—I am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the\n      European disease—The disease of the will is diffused unequally over\n      Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest\n      prevailed, it decreases according as \"the barbarian\" still—or again—asserts\n      his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in\n      the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that\n      the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly\n      aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into\n      something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its\n      intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of\n      all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover,\n      in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the\n      North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is\n      considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with\n      phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter—not to\n      mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must\n      first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most\n      surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were\n      flows back to Asia—namely, in Russia There the power to will has\n      been long stored up and accumulated, there the will—uncertain\n      whether to be negative or affirmative—waits threateningly to be\n      discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not\n      only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free\n      Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the\n      shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction\n      of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to\n      read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it,\n      in my heart I should rather prefer the contrary—I mean such an\n      increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to\n      make up its mind to become equally threatening—namely, TO ACQUIRE\n      ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a\n      persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of\n      years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and\n      its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be\n      brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century\n      will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world—the COMPULSION\n      to great politics.", "209": " As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have\n      evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger\n      kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely\n      by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand.\n      That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of\n      Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical genius—and\n      therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of\n      German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one\n      point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then\n      lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming\n      and serious than any lack of culture and social form—his ill-will to\n      the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN\n      WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son\n      was not man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not\n      have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to\n      the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmen—he saw in\n      the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected\n      the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for\n      evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer\n      ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new\n      kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism—who knows TO WHAT\n      EXTENT it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy\n      melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?—the skepticism of daring\n      manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest,\n      and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great\n      Frederick. This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines\n      and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose\n      itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard\n      over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued\n      Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a\n      considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical\n      and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough\n      masculine character of the great German philologists and historical\n      critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of\n      destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit\n      gradually established itself—in spite of all Romanticism in music\n      and philosophy—in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was\n      decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as\n      courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to\n      dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions\n      under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when\n      warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this\n      spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet\n      calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how\n      characteristic is this fear of the \"man\" in the German spirit which\n      awakened Europe out of its \"dogmatic slumber,\" let us call to mind the\n      former conception which had to be overcome by this new one—and that\n      it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with\n      unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe\n      as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us\n      only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw\n      Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the \"German\n      spirit\" \"VOILA UN HOMME!\"—that was as much as to say \"But this is a\n      MAN! And I only expected to see a German!\"", "210": " Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the\n      future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be\n      skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be\n      designated thereby—and not they themselves. With equal right they\n      might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of\n      experiments. By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have\n      already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting\n      is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use\n      of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In\n      their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and\n      painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic\n      century can approve of?—There is no doubt these coming ones will be\n      least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities\n      which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to\n      standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the\n      wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for\n      self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in\n      denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how\n      to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They\n      will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than\n      humane people may desire, they will not deal with the \"truth\" in order\n      that it may \"please\" them, or \"elevate\" and \"inspire\" them—they will\n      rather have little faith in \"TRUTH\" bringing with it such revels for the\n      feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in\n      their presence \"That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?\" or\n      \"That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?\" or \"That artist\n      enlarges me, why should he not be great?\" Perhaps they will not only have\n      a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic,\n      feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost\n      hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile\n      \"Christian sentiments\" with \"antique taste,\" or even with \"modern\n      parliamentarism\" (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among\n      philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory\n      century). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and\n      rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves\n      by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof\n      as their special adornment—nevertheless they will not want to be\n      called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to\n      philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that \"philosophy\n      itself is criticism and critical science—and nothing else whatever!\"\n      Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the\n      Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the\n      heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal\n      works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are\n      instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments,\n      they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman\n      of Konigsberg was only a great critic.", "211": " I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical\n      workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophers—that\n      precisely here one should strictly give \"each his own,\" and not give those\n      far too much, these far too little. It may be necessary for the education\n      of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all\n      those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy,\n      remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have\n      been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and\n      collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and\n      \"free spirit,\" and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range\n      of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of\n      eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth\n      up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only\n      preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something\n      else—it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers,\n      after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize\n      some great existing body of valuations—that is to say, former\n      DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent,\n      and are for a time called \"truths\"—whether in the domain of the\n      LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these\n      investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto,\n      conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten\n      everything long, even \"time\" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an\n      immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined\n      pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL\n      PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: \"Thus\n      SHALL it be!\" They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and\n      thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and\n      all subjugators of the past—they grasp at the future with a creative\n      hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an\n      instrument, and a hammer. Their \"knowing\" is CREATING, their creating is a\n      law-giving, their will to truth is—WILL TO POWER.—Are there at\n      present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST\n      there not be such philosophers some day? ...", "212": " It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man\n      INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found\n      himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day\n      in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day.\n      Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls\n      philosophers—who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but\n      rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators—have found\n      their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,\n      however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of\n      their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very\n      VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for\n      the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his\n      aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence,\n      self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under\n      the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was\n      OUTLIVED, they have always said \"We must remove hence to where YOU are\n      least at home\" In the face of a world of \"modern ideas,\" which would like\n      to confine every one in a corner, in a \"specialty,\" a philosopher, if\n      there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the\n      greatness of man, the conception of \"greatness,\" precisely in his\n      comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would\n      even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that\n      which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to\n      which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue\n      of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the\n      spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the\n      philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged\n      resolution, must specially be included in the conception of \"greatness\",\n      with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly,\n      renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite age—such\n      as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of\n      will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time\n      of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative\n      Athenians who let themselves go—\"for the sake of happiness,\" as they\n      said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicated—and who\n      had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long\n      forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for\n      greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and\n      plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and\n      heart of the \"noble,\" with a look that said plainly enough \"Do not\n      dissemble before me! here—we are equal!\" At present, on the\n      contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal alone attains to\n      honours, and dispenses honours, when \"equality of right\" can too readily\n      be transformed into equality in wrong—I mean to say into general war\n      against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man,\n      the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative\n      plenipotence and lordliness—at present it belongs to the conception\n      of \"greatness\" to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being\n      different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the\n      philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts \"He\n      shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed,\n      the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his\n      virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called\n      GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full.\" And\n      to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE—nowadays?", "213": " It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be\n      taught: one must \"know\" it by experience—or one should have the\n      pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things\n      of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and\n      unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:—the\n      very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas\n      about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical\n      combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace,\n      and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown\n      to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore,\n      should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them.\n      They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory\n      obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as\n      something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as\n      \"worthy of the SWEAT of the noble\"—but not at all as something easy\n      and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! \"To think\" and to\n      take a matter \"seriously,\" \"arduously\"—that is one and the same\n      thing to them; such only has been their \"experience.\"—Artists have\n      here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely\n      when they no longer do anything \"arbitrarily,\" and everything of\n      necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively\n      fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax—in short, that\n      necessity and \"freedom of will\" are then the same thing with them. There\n      is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the\n      gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems\n      repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being\n      predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his\n      spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or\n      clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian\n      ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this \"holy of\n      holies\"—as so often happens nowadays! But coarse feet must never\n      tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of\n      things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash\n      and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a high\n      station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has\n      only a right to philosophy—taking the word in its higher\n      significance—in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the \"blood,\"\n      decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way for the\n      coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately\n      acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy,\n      delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness\n      for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning\n      look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and\n      virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and\n      calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme\n      justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye\n      which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....", "214": " OUR Virtues?—It is probable that we, too, have still our\n      virtues, although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues\n      on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a\n      little distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we\n      firstlings of the twentieth century—with all our dangerous\n      curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and\n      seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit—we shall presumably,\n      IF we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with\n      our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent\n      requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!—where,\n      as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost!\n      And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it\n      not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this \"believing in one's\n      own virtues\"—is it not practically the same as what was formerly\n      called one's \"good conscience,\" that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,\n      which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough\n      also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however little\n      we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable\n      in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy\n      grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good\n      consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.—Ah! if you only knew\n      how soon, so very soon—it will be different!", "215": " As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which\n      determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different\n      colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green,\n      and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we\n      modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our \"firmament,\" are\n      determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in\n      different colours, and are seldom unequivocal—and there are often\n      cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.", "216": " To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes\n      place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at\n      times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:—we learn to DESPISE\n      when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however,\n      unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and\n      secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and\n      the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude—is opposed to our taste\n      nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers\n      that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste,\n      including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all\n      that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our\n      conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral\n      sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.", "217": " Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance\n      to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment! They\n      never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us (or even with\n      REGARD to us)—they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators\n      and detractors, even when they still remain our \"friends.\"—Blessed\n      are the forgetful: for they \"get the better\" even of their blunders.", "218": " The psychologists of France—and where else are there still\n      psychologists nowadays?—have never yet exhausted their bitter and\n      manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in short,\n      they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest citizen\n      of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was\n      his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is growing\n      wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a\n      pleasure—namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,\n      honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks\n      they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is\n      a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the\n      middle-class in its best moments—subtler even than the understanding\n      of its victims:—a repeated proof that \"instinct\" is the most\n      intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been\n      discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the\n      \"rule\" in its struggle with the \"exception\": there you have a spectacle\n      fit for Gods and godlike malignity!

They are glad in their inmost heart that there is a\n      standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual\n      goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the \"equality of\n      all before God,\" and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose. It is\n      among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. If any\n      one were to say to them \"A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison\n      with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man\"—it would\n      make them furious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter\n      them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the\n      ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all\n      qualities attributed to the \"merely moral\" man, after they have been\n      acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole\n      series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the\n      spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it\n      is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among\n      things—and not only among men.", "220": " Now that the praise of the \"disinterested person\" is so popular one\n      must—probably not without some danger—get an idea of WHAT\n      people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally\n      which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men—including\n      the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if\n      appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the\n      greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined\n      and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely \"uninteresting\" to the average man—if,\n      notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it\n      desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act \"disinterestedly.\"\n      There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a\n      seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did\n      not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked\n      and candidly reasonable truth that \"disinterested\" action is very\n      interesting and \"interested\" action, provided that... \"And love?\"—What!\n      Even an action for love's sake shall be \"unegoistic\"? But you fools—!\n      \"And the praise of the self-sacrificer?\"—But whoever has really\n      offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it—perhaps\n      something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished\n      here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even\n      feel himself \"more.\" But this is a realm of questions and answers in which\n      a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to\n      stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer. And after all,\n      truth is a woman; one must not use force with her.", "221": " \"It sometimes happens,\" said a moralistic pedant and trifle-retailer,\n      \"that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is\n      unselfish, but because I think he has a right to be useful to another man\n      at his own expense. In short, the question is always who HE is, and who\n      THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person created and destined for command,\n      self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the\n      waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality\n      which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins\n      against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an\n      ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropy—and precisely a\n      seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of\n      men. Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the\n      GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their\n      conscience—until they thoroughly understand at last that it is\n      IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.'\"—So\n      said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be\n      laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality?\n      But one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the\n      laughers on ONE'S OWN side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.", "222": " Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays—and,\n      if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached—let\n      the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all\n      the noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he\n      will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to\n      the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase\n      for a century (the first symptoms of which are already specified\n      documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame d'Epinay)—IF\n      IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF!

Let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to\n      these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also\n      with respect to its moments of desperation on account of \"nothing suiting\"\n      us.

By means of our\n      semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere,\n      such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth\n      of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has\n      at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part\n      of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the\n      \"historical sense\" implies almost the sense and instinct for everything,\n      the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself\n      to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is\n      perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer,\n      whom men of distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth\n      century, like Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and\n      even Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so\n      easily appropriate—whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy.\n      The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready\n      disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange,\n      their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the\n      averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new\n      desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what\n      is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even\n      towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could\n      not become their prey—and no faculty is more unintelligible to such\n      men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian\n      curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous\n      Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of\n      the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or\n      irritation: but we—accept precisely this wild motleyness, this\n      medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,\n      with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of\n      art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little\n      disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace\n      in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on the Chiaja of\n      Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and\n      voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower quarters of the\n      town. That as men of the \"historical sense\" we have our virtues, is not to\n      be disputed:—we are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave,\n      habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very\n      patient, very complaisant—but with all this we are perhaps not very\n      \"tasteful.\" Let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us\n      men of the \"historical sense\" to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds\n      us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the\n      perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially\n      noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon\n      self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that\n      have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical\n      sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad\n      taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and\n      with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of\n      human life as they shine here and there: those moments and marvelous\n      experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the\n      boundless and infinite,—when a super-abundance of refined delight\n      has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly\n      and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS\n      is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really\n      the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable. Like the rider on his\n      forward panting horse, we let the reins fall before the infinite, we\n      modern men, we semi-barbarians—and are only in OUR highest bliss\n      when we—ARE IN MOST DANGER.", "225": " Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,\n      all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to\n      PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances and\n      secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and naivetes,\n      which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's conscience\n      will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy.

It is desirable that as few\n      people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very\n      desirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But let us\n      not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have always been: I see\n      no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an idea of the fact that\n      philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous,\n      captious, and ensnaring manner—that CALAMITY might be involved\n      therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English\n      utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along\n      (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just\n      as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius!\n      (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to\n      use an expression of Galiani). No new thought, nothing of the nature of a\n      finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper\n      history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE\n      literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with\n      some mischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL\n      TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must\n      certainly read with an eye to their motives if one MUST read them),\n      concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover,\n      there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of\n      conscience, from which a race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in\n      all their scientific tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the\n      opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality\n      as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is\n      moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be\n      recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the \"general\n      utility,\" or \"the happiness of the greatest number,\"—no! the\n      happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all\n      means, to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I\n      mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in\n      Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in\n      so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just\n      consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,\n      conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause\n      of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge\n      or inkling of the facts that the \"general welfare\" is no ideal, no goal,\n      no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,—that\n      what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another, that the\n      requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men,\n      in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and\n      consequently between morality and morality. They are an unassuming and\n      fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, and,\n      as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think\n      highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has\n      been partially attempted in the following rhymes:—", "229": " In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there\n      still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the\n      \"cruel wild beast,\" the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of\n      these humaner ages—that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement\n      of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the\n      appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. I\n      perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let others\n      capture it again and give it so much \"milk of pious sentiment\" [FOOTNOTE:\n      An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink,\n      that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.—One\n      ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last\n      to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errors—as,\n      for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with\n      regard to tragedy—may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly.\n      Almost everything that we call \"higher culture\" is based upon the\n      spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY—this is my thesis; the\n      \"wild beast\" has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has\n      only been—transfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight\n      of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic\n      sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest\n      and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely\n      from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the Roman enjoys in the\n      arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the\n      sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day\n      Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian\n      suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne\n      who, with unhinged will, \"undergoes\" the performance of \"Tristan and\n      Isolde\"—what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to\n      drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe \"cruelty.\" Here, to be sure,\n      we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times,\n      which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the\n      sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant\n      enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own suffering—and\n      wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the\n      RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and\n      ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and\n      contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience\n      and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and\n      impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty\n      TOWARDS HIMSELF.—Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of\n      knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he\n      compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often\n      enough against the wishes of his heart:—he forces it to say Nay,\n      where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of\n      taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an\n      intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which\n      instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,—even in every\n      desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.", "230": " Perhaps what I have said here about a \"fundamental will of the\n      spirit\" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a\n      word of explanation.—That imperious something which is popularly\n      called \"the spirit,\" wishes to be master internally and externally, and to\n      feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a\n      binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. Its requirements\n      and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to\n      everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to\n      appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to\n      assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or\n      repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily\n      re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits\n      and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the \"outside\n      world.\" Its object thereby is the incorporation of new \"experiences,\" the\n      assortment of new things in the old arrangements—in short, growth;\n      or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power—is\n      its object. This same will has at its service an apparently opposed\n      impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of\n      arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or\n      that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much\n      that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in\n      horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all\n      necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its\n      \"digestive power,\" to speak figuratively (and in fact \"the spirit\"\n      resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here also belong an\n      occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps\n      with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to\n      pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting\n      enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the\n      too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the\n      misshapen, the beautified—an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all\n      these manifestations of power. Finally, in this connection, there is the\n      not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and\n      dissemble before them—the constant pressing and straining of a\n      creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its\n      craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of\n      security therein—it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best\n      protected and concealed!—COUNTER TO this propensity for appearance,\n      for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outside—for\n      every outside is a cloak—there operates the sublime tendency of the\n      man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly,\n      variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual\n      conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in\n      himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened\n      his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe\n      discipline and even severe words. He will say: \"There is something cruel\n      in the tendency of my spirit\": let the virtuous and amiable try to\n      convince him that it is not so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead\n      of our cruelty, perhaps our \"extravagant honesty\" were talked about,\n      whispered about, and glorified—we free, VERY free spirits—and\n      some day perhaps SUCH will actually be our—posthumous glory!\n      Meanwhile—for there is plenty of time until then—we should be\n      least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral\n      verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and\n      its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful, glistening, jingling,\n      festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for\n      knowledge, heroism of the truthful—there is something in them that\n      makes one's heart swell with pride. But we anchorites and marmots have\n      long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's\n      conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old\n      false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and\n      that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible\n      original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In effect, to\n      translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and\n      visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto\n      been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to\n      bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now,\n      hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of\n      nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the\n      enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far\n      too long: \"Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!\"—this\n      may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny!\n      Why did we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question\n      differently: \"Why knowledge at all?\" Every one will ask us about this. And\n      thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times,\n      have not found and cannot find any better answer....", "231": " Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not\n      merely \"conserve\"—as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of\n      our souls, quite \"down below,\" there is certainly something unteachable, a\n      granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to\n      predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an\n      unchangeable \"I am this\"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman,\n      for instance, but can only learn fully—he can only follow to the end\n      what is \"fixed\" about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain\n      solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are\n      henceforth called \"convictions.\" Later on—one sees in them only\n      footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves\n      ARE—or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our\n      spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite \"down below.\"—In view\n      of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will\n      perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about \"woman as\n      she is,\" provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are\n      merely—MY truths.", "232": " Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten\n      men about \"woman as she is\"—THIS is one of the worst developments of\n      the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these clumsy attempts of\n      feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring to light! Woman has so\n      much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality,\n      schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion\n      concealed—study only woman's behaviour towards children!—which\n      has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the FEAR of man.\n      Alas, if ever the \"eternally tedious in woman\"—she has plenty of it!—is\n      allowed to venture forth! if she begins radically and on principle to\n      unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away\n      sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate\n      aptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised, which,\n      by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:—with medical explicitness it\n      is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from\n      man. Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to\n      be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,\n      men's gift—we remained therewith \"among ourselves\"; and in the end,\n      in view of all that women write about \"woman,\" we may well have\n      considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about\n      herself—and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new\n      ORNAMENT for herself—I believe ornamentation belongs to the\n      eternally feminine?—why, then, she wishes to make herself feared:\n      perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth—what\n      does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,\n      more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth—her great art is\n      falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it,\n      we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman:\n      we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company\n      of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our\n      seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us.\n      Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge\n      profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it not\n      true that on the whole \"woman\" has hitherto been most despised by woman\n      herself, and not at all by us?—We men desire that woman should not\n      continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was man's\n      care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier\n      taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon gave the\n      too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis!—and\n      in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today:\n      mulier taceat de mulierel.", "233": " It betrays corruption of the instincts—apart from the fact that\n      it betrays bad taste—when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame\n      de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby\n      in favour of \"woman as she is.\" Among men, these are the three comical\n      women as they are—nothing more!—and just the best involuntary\n      counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.", "234": " Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness\n      with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is\n      managed!

If woman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly,\n      as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most important\n      physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession of the\n      healing art! Through bad female cooks—through the entire lack of\n      reason in the kitchen—the development of mankind has been longest\n      retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little\n      better.

Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de\n      Lambert to her son: \"MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES, QUI\n      VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR\"—the motherliest and wisest remark, by the\n      way, that was ever addressed to a son.", "236": " I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and\n      Goethe believed about woman—the former when he sang, \"ELLA GUARDAVA\n      SUSO, ED IO IN LEI,\" and the latter when he interpreted it, \"the eternally\n      feminine draws us ALOFT\"; for THIS is just what she believes of the\n      eternally masculine.", "237": " SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMENAge, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aidSombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame—discreetYoung, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam237A", "238": " To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of \"man and woman,\" to deny\n      here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile\n      tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal\n      claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and\n      a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot—shallow\n      in instinct!—may generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as\n      betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove too \"short\" for all\n      fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be\n      unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other hand, a man who has\n      depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has also the depth of\n      benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and easily\n      confounded with them, can only think of woman as ORIENTALS do: he must\n      conceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being\n      predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein—he\n      must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of Asia,\n      upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly;\n      those best heirs and scholars of Asia—who, as is well known, with\n      their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time of\n      Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short, more\n      Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely desirable this\n      was, let us consider for ourselves!", "239": " The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much\n      respect by men as at present—this belongs to the tendency and\n      fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to\n      old age—what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of\n      this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of\n      respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,\n      indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is\n      losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste.\n      She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who \"unlearns to fear\"\n      sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward\n      when the fear-inspiring quality in man—or more definitely, the MAN\n      in man—is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable\n      enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand\n      is that precisely thereby—woman deteriorates. This is what is\n      happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the\n      industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit,\n      woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: \"woman\n      as clerkess\" is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in\n      course of formation. While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be\n      \"master,\" and inscribes \"progress\" of woman on her flags and banners, the\n      very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN\n      RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe\n      has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and\n      the \"emancipation of woman,\" insofar as it is desired and demanded by\n      women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to\n      be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the\n      most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost\n      masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman—who is always a\n      sensible woman—might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as\n      to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect\n      exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man,\n      perhaps even \"to the book,\" where formerly she kept herself in control and\n      in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity\n      man's faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something\n      eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade\n      man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and\n      indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic\n      animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of\n      servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing\n      order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a\n      counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of\n      every elevation of culture):—what does all this betoken, if not a\n      disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are\n      enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses\n      of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this\n      manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which \"man\" in Europe,\n      European \"manliness,\" suffers,—who would like to lower woman to\n      \"general culture,\" indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with\n      politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits\n      and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be\n      something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;—almost\n      everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous\n      kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more\n      hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function,\n      that of bearing robust children. They wish to \"cultivate\" her in general\n      still more, and intend, as they say, to make the \"weaker sex\" STRONG by\n      culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the\n      \"cultivating\" of mankind and his weakening—that is to say, the\n      weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL—have\n      always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and\n      influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had\n      just to thank their force of will—and not their schoolmasters—for\n      their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in woman,\n      and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more \"natural\" than\n      that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her\n      tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness\n      and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of\n      her desires and virtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one's\n      sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, \"woman,\" is that she seems\n      more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more\n      condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy it\n      is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of\n      woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it\n      delights—What? And all that is now to be at an end? And the\n      DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The tediousness of woman is slowly\n      evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know the horned animal which was always\n      most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee!\n      Thy old fable might once more become \"history\"—an immense stupidity\n      might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed\n      beneath it—no! only an \"idea,\" a \"modern idea\"!", "240": " I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture to\n      the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,\n      latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music\n      as still living, in order that it may be understood:—it is an honour\n      to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours and\n      forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses\n      us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too\n      modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not\n      infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse—it has fire and\n      courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which\n      ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of\n      inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect,\n      an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it\n      broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight—the most\n      manifold delight,—of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the\n      joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished,\n      happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new,\n      newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently\n      betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the\n      delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly\n      a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as\n      though the artist wished to say to us: \"It is part of my intention\"; a\n      cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a\n      flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something\n      German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German\n      style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and\n      super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the\n      RAFFINEMENTS of decadence—which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease\n      there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time\n      young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of\n      music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day\n      before yesterday and the day after tomorrow—THEY HAVE AS YET NO\n      TODAY.", "241": " We \"good Europeans,\" we also have hours when we allow ourselves a\n      warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow\n      views—I have just given an example of it—hours of national\n      excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned\n      floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what\n      confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours—in\n      a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,\n      according to the speed and strength with which they digest and \"change\n      their material.\" Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,\n      which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere\n      they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and\n      soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to \"good\n      Europeanism.\" And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become\n      an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriots—they were\n      evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. \"HE\n      has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a\n      corps-student,\" said the one—\"he is still innocent. But what does\n      that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly\n      before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman\n      who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and\n      power, they call 'great'—what does it matter that we more prudent\n      and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is\n      only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair.\n      Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being\n      obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by\n      nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice\n      their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful\n      mediocrity;—supposing a statesman were to condemn his people\n      generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something\n      better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they\n      have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the\n      restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially\n      politics-practising nations;—supposing such a statesman were to\n      stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to\n      make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an\n      offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate\n      their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their\n      minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'—what! a statesman who\n      should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for\n      throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman\n      would be GREAT, would he?\"—\"Undoubtedly!\" replied the other old\n      patriot vehemently, \"otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad\n      perhaps to wish such a thing!

NOT\n      great!\"—The old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted\n      their \"truths\" in each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and\n      apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the\n      strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual\n      superficialising of a nation—namely, in the deepening of another.", "242": " Whether we call it \"civilization,\" or \"humanising,\" or \"progress,\"\n      which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without\n      praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in\n      Europe—behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by\n      such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever\n      extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their increasing\n      detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily,\n      united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite\n      milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands\n      on soul and body,—that is to say, the slow emergence of an\n      essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who possesses,\n      physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as\n      his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can\n      be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and\n      grow thereby in vehemence and depth—the still-raging storm and\n      stress of \"national sentiment\" pertains to it, and also the anarchism\n      which is appearing at present—this process will probably arrive at\n      results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of\n      \"modern ideas,\" would least care to reckon. The same new conditions under\n      which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place—a\n      useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious man—are\n      in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most\n      dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for\n      adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a\n      new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the\n      POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of\n      such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative,\n      weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as\n      they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of\n      Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the\n      most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in\n      individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has\n      perhaps ever been before—owing to the unprejudicedness of his\n      schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I\n      meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an\n      involuntary arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS—taking the word\n      in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.", "243": " I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the\n      constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do like\n      the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!", "244": " There was a time when it was customary to call Germans \"deep\" by way\n      of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is\n      covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses \"smartness\" in all\n      that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we\n      did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short,\n      whether German depth is not at bottom something different and worse—and\n      something from which, thank God, we are on the point of successfully\n      ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German\n      depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of\n      the German soul.—The German soul is above all manifold, varied in\n      its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this\n      is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden himself to assert:\n      \"Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,\" would make a bad guess at the\n      truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the\n      number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and\n      mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan\n      element as the \"people of the centre\" in every sense of the term, the\n      Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown,\n      more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other\n      peoples are to themselves:—they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby\n      alone the despair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that\n      the question: \"What is German?\" never dies out among them. Kotzebue\n      certainly knew his Germans well enough: \"We are known,\" they cried\n      jubilantly to him—but Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew\n      what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at Fichte's lying but\n      patriotic flatteries and exaggerations,—but it is probable that\n      Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he\n      acknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what\n      Goethe really thought about the Germans?—But about many things\n      around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep\n      an astute silence—probably he had good reason for it. It is certain\n      that it was not the \"Wars of Independence\" that made him look up more\n      joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,—the event on\n      account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his \"Faust,\" and indeed the whole\n      problem of \"man,\" was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of\n      Goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign\n      land, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous\n      German turn of mind as \"Indulgence towards its own and others'\n      weaknesses.\" Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans that one is\n      seldom entirely wrong about them. The German soul has passages and\n      galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its\n      disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the German is well\n      acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything loves its symbol,\n      so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving,\n      crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything\n      uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is \"deep\". The German\n      himself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is \"developing himself\".\n      \"Development\" is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the\n      great domain of philosophical formulas,—a ruling idea, which,\n      together with German beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all\n      Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the\n      conflicting nature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them\n      (riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to\n      music). \"Good-natured and spiteful\"—such a juxtaposition,\n      preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too\n      often justified in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians\n      to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social\n      distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and\n      nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any\n      one wishes to see the \"German soul\" demonstrated ad oculos, let him only\n      look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish indifference\n      to \"taste\"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in\n      juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of\n      this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he\n      experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets \"done\" with them;\n      and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating \"digestion.\" And\n      just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so\n      the German loves \"frankness\" and \"honesty\"; it is so CONVENIENT to be\n      frank and honest!—This confidingness, this complaisance, this\n      showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and\n      most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his\n      proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can \"still achieve much\"! The\n      German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty\n      German eyes—and other countries immediately confound him with his\n      dressing-gown!—I meant to say that, let \"German depth\" be what it\n      will—among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at\n      it—we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance\n      and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a\n      people of depth for Prussian \"smartness,\" and Berlin wit and sand. It is\n      wise for a people to pose, and LET itself be regarded, as profound,\n      clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even be—profound\n      to do so! Finally, we should do honour to our name—we are not called\n      the \"TIUSCHE VOLK\" (deceptive people) for nothing....", "245": " The \"good old\" time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart—how\n      happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his \"good company,\"\n      his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and its\n      flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the\n      amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can still\n      appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be over\n      with it!—but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with\n      the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of\n      a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a\n      great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven is the\n      intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking\n      down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread\n      over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,—the\n      same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when\n      it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost\n      fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly does THIS very\n      sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of\n      this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller,\n      Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of\n      Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!—Whatever\n      German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a\n      movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting,\n      and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe\n      from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber—but\n      what do WE care nowadays for \"Freischutz\" and \"Oberon\"! Or Marschner's\n      \"Hans Heiling\" and \"Vampyre\"! Or even Wagner's \"Tannhauser\"! That is\n      extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of\n      Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to\n      maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses;\n      from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of\n      by genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that\n      halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul,\n      quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the\n      beautiful EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who\n      took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first—he\n      was the last that founded a school,—do we not now regard it as a\n      satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of\n      Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the \"Saxon\n      Switzerland\" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like\n      nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)—his\n      MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of\n      injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste\n      (that is to say, a dangerous propensity—doubly dangerous among\n      Germans—for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going\n      constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who\n      revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a\n      sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE—this Schumann was already merely a\n      GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had\n      been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German\n      music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE\n      FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.", "246": " What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a\n      THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of\n      sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a\n      \"book\"! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly,\n      how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to\n      know, that there is ART in every good sentence—art which must be\n      divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a\n      misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is\n      misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining\n      syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as\n      intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to\n      every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the sense in the\n      sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they\n      can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement—who\n      among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties\n      and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language?\n      After all, one just \"has no ear for it\"; and so the most marked contrasts\n      of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were\n      SQUANDERED on the deaf.—These were my thoughts when I noticed how\n      clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-writing have\n      been confounded: one, whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly, as\n      from the roof of a damp cave—he counts on their dull sound and echo;\n      and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from\n      his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering,\n      over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.", "247": " How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear,\n      is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write\n      badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but\n      only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time.\n      In antiquity when a man read—which was seldom enough—he read\n      something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any\n      one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice:\n      that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key\n      and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The\n      laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style;\n      and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined\n      requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and\n      power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a\n      physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath. Such\n      periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking\n      twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who\n      knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the\n      rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period;—WE\n      have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are short of\n      breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti\n      in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics—they\n      thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in\n      the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing,\n      the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its\n      elevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of\n      platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young\n      wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and\n      APPROXIMATELY artistical discourse—that delivered from the pulpit.\n      The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable\n      or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and\n      comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a\n      bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory\n      should be especially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too\n      late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good reason the\n      masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best\n      German book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is\n      merely \"literature\"—something which has not grown in Germany, and\n      therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the\n      Bible has done.", "248": " There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and\n      seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified\n      and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are those\n      on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the secret task\n      of forming, maturing, and perfecting—the Greeks, for instance, were\n      a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others which have to\n      fructify and become the cause of new modes of life—like the Jews,\n      the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans?—nations\n      tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of\n      themselves, amorous and longing for foreign races (for such as \"let\n      themselves be fructified\"), and withal imperious, like everything\n      conscious of being full of generative force, and consequently empowered\n      \"by the grace of God.\" These two kinds of geniuses seek each other like\n      man and woman; but they also misunderstand each other—like man and\n      woman.", "249": " Every nation has its own \"Tartuffery,\" and calls that its virtue.—One\n      does not know—cannot know, the best that is in one.", "250": " What Europe owes to the Jews?—Many things, good and bad, and\n      above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the\n      grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands,\n      of infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral\n      questionableness—and consequently just the most attractive,\n      ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to\n      life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its\n      evening sky, now glows—perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among\n      the spectators and philosophers, are—grateful to the Jews.", "251": " It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbances—in\n      short, slight attacks of stupidity—pass over the spirit of a people\n      that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political\n      ambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the\n      anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the\n      Christian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the\n      Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and\n      Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these\n      little obscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May\n      it be forgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very\n      infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like\n      every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not\n      concern me—the first symptom of political infection. About the Jews,\n      for instance, listen to the following:—I have never yet met a German\n      who was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the\n      repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and\n      political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against\n      the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess,\n      and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this\n      excess of sentiment;—on this point we must not deceive ourselves.\n      That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the\n      German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing\n      only of this quantity of \"Jew\"—as the Italian, the Frenchman, and\n      the Englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:—that is\n      the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which\n      one must listen and according to which one must act. \"Let no more Jews\n      come in! And shut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards\n      Austria)!\"—thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is\n      still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily\n      extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt\n      the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they\n      know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than\n      under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would\n      like nowadays to label as vices—owing above all to a resolute faith\n      which does not need to be ashamed before \"modern ideas\", they alter only,\n      WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes its\n      conquest—as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of\n      yesterday—namely, according to the principle, \"as slowly as\n      possible\"! A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all\n      his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he\n      will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest\n      factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present\n      called a \"nation\" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA\n      (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in\n      every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a\n      race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such \"nations\"\n      should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostility! It is\n      certain that the Jews, if they desired—or if they were driven to it,\n      as the anti-Semites seem to wish—COULD now have the ascendancy, nay,\n      literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and\n      planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and\n      desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe,\n      they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and\n      wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the \"wandering Jew\",—and\n      one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE\n      ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts)\n      for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the\n      anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One should make advances with all\n      prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It\n      stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new\n      Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least\n      hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it\n      would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and\n      patience (and especially some intellect and intellectuality—sadly\n      lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and\n      trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying—for both of\n      which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is\n      expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania\n      for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the \"European problem,\" as I\n      understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.", "252": " They are not a philosophical race—the English: Bacon represents\n      an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke,\n      an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a \"philosopher\" for more\n      than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;\n      it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, \"JE MEPRISE LOCKE\"; in the\n      struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel\n      and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile\n      brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards\n      the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as\n      only brothers will do.—What is lacking in England, and has always\n      been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd\n      muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what\n      he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle—real\n      POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short,\n      philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold\n      on firmly to Christianity—they NEED its discipline for \"moralizing\"\n      and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and\n      brutal than the German—is for that very reason, as the baser of the\n      two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To\n      finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a\n      characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which,\n      owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote—the finer poison to\n      neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in\n      advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. The\n      English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily\n      disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or,\n      more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and\n      for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting\n      under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the \"Salvation\n      Army\"), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest\n      manifestation of \"humanity\" to which they can be elevated: so much may\n      reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the humanest\n      Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also\n      literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul\n      and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for \"music.\"\n      Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING—in\n      no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally,\n      listen to them singing!

Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful\n      thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an\n      error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as\n      specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common\n      facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather\n      from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are \"the\n      rules.\" After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:—in\n      effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new,\n      they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity\n      is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable\n      man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant\n      person;—while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like\n      those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious\n      carefulness (in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for\n      arriving at them.—Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English,\n      with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general\n      depression of European intelligence.What is called \"modern ideas,\" or \"the ideas of the eighteenth century,\"\n      or \"French ideas\"—that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind\n      rose up with profound disgust—is of English origin, there is no\n      doubt about it", "254": " Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual and\n      refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one\n      must know how to find this \"France of taste.\" He who belongs to it keeps\n      himself well concealed:—they may be a small number in whom it lives\n      and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the\n      strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part\n      persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal\n      themselves.They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence\n      of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS", "255": " I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.\n      Suppose a person loves the South as I love it—as a great school of\n      recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless\n      solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence\n      believing in itself—well, such a person will learn to be somewhat on\n      his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it\n      will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by\n      origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also\n      dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in\n      his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and\n      mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die\n      away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and\n      the Mediterranean clearness of sky—a super-European music, which\n      holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose\n      soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big,\n      beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I could imagine a music of which the\n      rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only\n      that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden\n      shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which,\n      from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost\n      incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable\n      enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives.", "256": " Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has\n      induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the\n      short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this\n      craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the\n      disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude\n      policy—owing to all this and much else that is altogether\n      unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES\n      TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted.\n      With all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real\n      general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare\n      the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European\n      of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in\n      old age perhaps, did they belong to the \"fatherlands\"—they only\n      rested from themselves when they became \"patriots.\" I think of such men as\n      Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it\n      must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about\n      whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings\n      (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still\n      less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and\n      opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and\n      the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and\n      intimately related to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in\n      all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE\n      Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards,\n      in their multifarious and boisterous art—whither? into a new light?\n      towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express accurately what all\n      these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly? It is\n      certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in\n      the same manner, these last great seekers! All of them steeped in\n      literature to their eyes and ears—the first artists of universal\n      literary culture—for the most part even themselves writers, poets,\n      intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as\n      musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist\n      generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION \"at any cost\"—I\n      specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them\n      great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and\n      dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of\n      the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out\n      VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures,\n      constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line,\n      hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and\n      the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus,\n      who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life\n      and action—think of Balzac, for instance,—unrestrained\n      workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in\n      manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all\n      of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and\n      with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently\n      profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);—on\n      the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and\n      aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their\n      century—and it is the century of the MASSES—the conception\n      \"higher man.\"... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together\n      as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or\n      whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from\n      SUPER-GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be\n      underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type,\n      which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most\n      decisive time—and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his\n      self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French\n      socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be\n      found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has acted\n      in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a\n      nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done—owing to the\n      circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the\n      French;—perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner\n      is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and\n      inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,\n      that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful,\n      too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized\n      nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin\n      Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days,\n      when—anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics—he\n      began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least,\n      THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.—That these last words may\n      not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which\n      will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean—what I mean\n      COUNTER TO the \"last Wagner\" and his Parsifal music:—", "257": " EVERY elevation of the type \"man,\" has hitherto been the work of an\n      aristocratic society and so it will always be—a society believing in\n      a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human\n      beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS OF\n      DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out\n      of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on\n      subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice\n      of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distance—that\n      other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an\n      ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of\n      ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in\n      short, just the elevation of the type \"man,\" the continued\n      \"self-surmounting of man,\" to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense.\n      To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions\n      about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to\n      say, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type \"man\"):\n      the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher\n      civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a still natural nature,\n      barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in\n      possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw\n      themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading\n      or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which\n      the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and\n      depravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian\n      caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical,\n      but in their psychical power—they were more COMPLETE men (which at\n      every point also implies the same as \"more complete beasts\").", "258": " Corruption—as the indication that anarchy threatens to break\n      out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called\n      \"life,\" is convulsed—is something radically different according to\n      the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an\n      aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution, flung\n      away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an\n      excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:—it was really\n      only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by\n      virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly\n      prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the end even\n      to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing, however, in a\n      good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a\n      function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the\n      SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof—that it should\n      therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of\n      individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to\n      imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be\n      precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only\n      as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of\n      beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in\n      general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants in\n      Java—they are called Sipo Matador,—which encircle an oak so\n      long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but\n      supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit\n      their happiness.", "259": " To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation,\n      and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a\n      certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary\n      conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in\n      amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one\n      organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more\n      generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY,\n      it would immediately disclose what it really is—namely, a Will to\n      the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one must\n      think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness:\n      life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange\n      and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms,\n      incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation;—but\n      why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a\n      disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the organization within which,\n      as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equal—it\n      takes place in every healthy aristocracy—must itself, if it be a\n      living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies,\n      which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will\n      have to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to\n      gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy—not owing to\n      any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS\n      precisely Will to Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary\n      consciousness of Europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this\n      matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about\n      coming conditions of society in which \"the exploiting character\" is to be\n      absent—that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode\n      of life which should refrain from all organic functions. \"Exploitation\"\n      does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it\n      belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function,\n      it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the\n      Will to Life—Granting that as a theory this is a novelty—as a\n      reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest\n      towards ourselves!", "260": " In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have\n      hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits\n      recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until\n      finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical\n      distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and\n      SLAVE-MORALITY,—I would at once add, however, that in all higher and\n      mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the\n      two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual\n      misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition—even\n      in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions of moral values have\n      either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being\n      different from the ruled—or among the ruled class, the slaves and\n      dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is the rulers who\n      determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud disposition\n      which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines\n      the order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings\n      in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he\n      despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality\n      the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" means practically the same as \"noble\" and\n      \"despicable\",—the antithesis \"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different\n      origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking\n      merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful,\n      with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men\n      who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the\n      liars:—it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common\n      people are untruthful. \"We truthful ones\"—the nobility in ancient\n      Greece called themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations\n      of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only derivatively\n      and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake,\n      therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, \"Why have\n      sympathetic actions been praised?\" The noble type of man regards HIMSELF\n      as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he\n      passes the judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he\n      knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a\n      CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such\n      morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling\n      of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high\n      tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:—the\n      noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not—or scarcely—out\n      of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of\n      power. The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has\n      power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who\n      takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has\n      reverence for all that is severe and hard. \"Wotan placed a hard heart in\n      my breast,\" says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed\n      from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not\n      being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:\n      \"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.\" The noble\n      and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which\n      sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\n      DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride\n      in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as\n      definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in\n      presence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"—It is the powerful who\n      KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The\n      profound reverence for age and for tradition—all law rests on this\n      double reverence,—the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors\n      and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful;\n      and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost instinctively in\n      \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and more lacking in respect for\n      old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has complacently betrayed\n      itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class, however, is more\n      especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of\n      its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act\n      towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems\n      good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\" and in any case \"beyond good and\n      evil\": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place.\n      The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged\n      revenge—both only within the circle of equals,—artfulness in\n      retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to\n      have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness,\n      arrogance—in fact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are\n      typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed\n      out, is not the morality of \"modern ideas,\" and is therefore at present\n      difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose.—It is\n      otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that\n      the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary,\n      and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common\n      element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic suspicion with\n      regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a\n      condemnation of man, together with his situation. The slave has an\n      unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and\n      distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything \"good\" that is there\n      honoured—he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness\n      there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to\n      alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and\n      flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the\n      warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to\n      honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only\n      means of supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially\n      the morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the famous\n      antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\":—power and dangerousness are assumed to\n      reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which\n      do not admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore,\n      the \"evil\" man arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely\n      the \"good\" man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man\n      is regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum\n      when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a\n      shade of depreciation—it may be slight and well-intentioned—at\n      last attaches itself to the \"good\" man of this morality; because,\n      according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be\n      the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little\n      stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy,\n      language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words\n      \"good\" and \"stupid.\"—A last fundamental difference: the desire for\n      FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of\n      liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice\n      and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an\n      aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.—Hence we can\n      understand without further detail why love AS A PASSION—it is our\n      European specialty—must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well\n      known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those\n      brilliant, ingenious men of the \"gai saber,\" to whom Europe owes so much,\n      and almost owes itself.", "261": " Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a\n      noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind\n      of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to\n      represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of\n      themselves which they themselves do not possess—and consequently\n      also do not \"deserve,\"—and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion\n      afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so\n      self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable,\n      that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about\n      it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: \"I may\n      be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand\n      that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it:—that,\n      however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is\n      called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').\" Or he will even say: \"For many\n      reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because I\n      love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because\n      their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good\n      opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I\n      do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:—all\n      this, however, is not vanity.\" The man of noble character must first bring\n      it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that,\n      from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the\n      ordinary man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:—not being at all\n      accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other\n      value than that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT\n      OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an\n      extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still\n      always WAITING for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively\n      submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a \"good\" opinion, but\n      also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of\n      the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn\n      from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian learns\n      from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic\n      social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and\n      slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a\n      value to themselves and to \"think well\" of themselves, will now be more\n      and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older,\n      ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it—and in\n      the phenomenon of \"vanity\" this older propensity overmasters the younger.\n      The vain person rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about\n      himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally\n      regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad\n      opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to\n      both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.—It\n      is \"the slave\" in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's\n      craftiness—and how much of the \"slave\" is still left in woman, for\n      instance!—which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is\n      the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before\n      these opinions, as though he had not called them forth.—And to\n      repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.", "262": " A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in\n      the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On\n      the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species\n      which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of\n      protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop\n      variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in\n      monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient\n      Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the\n      purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men beside one another,\n      thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail,\n      chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else run the terrible danger of\n      being exterminated. The favour, the super-abundance, the protection are\n      there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs\n      itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its\n      hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general\n      prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its\n      neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals. The most\n      varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it\n      principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and\n      men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues,\n      and these virtues alone it develops to maturity. It does so with severity,\n      indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in\n      the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs,\n      in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye\n      only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the\n      virtues, under the name of \"justice.\" A type with few, but very marked\n      features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and\n      reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the\n      charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the\n      vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform\n      UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type\n      becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things\n      results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more\n      enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the\n      enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond\n      and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as\n      necessary, as a condition of existence—if it would continue, it can\n      only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations,\n      whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or\n      deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the\n      greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual\n      and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest\n      themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a\n      magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a\n      kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary\n      decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly\n      exploding egoisms, which strive with one another \"for sun and light,\" and\n      can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves\n      by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this morality itself\n      which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent the bow in so\n      threatening a manner:—it is now \"out of date,\" it is getting \"out of\n      date.\" The dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the\n      greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old\n      morality; the \"individual\" stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to\n      his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation,\n      self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing but new \"Whys,\" nothing but\n      new \"Hows,\" no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard\n      in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires\n      frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the\n      cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and\n      Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still\n      inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger is again present, the\n      mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual,\n      into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into\n      their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their\n      desires and volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this\n      time have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers,\n      that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays\n      and produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow,\n      except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have\n      a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves—they will be the\n      men of the future, the sole survivors; \"be like them! become mediocre!\" is\n      now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains\n      a hearing.—But it is difficult to preach this morality of\n      mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it desires! it has to\n      talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly love—it will\n      have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!", "263": " There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is\n      already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES of\n      reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The\n      refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test\n      when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not yet\n      protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities:\n      something that goes its way like a living touchstone, undistinguished,\n      undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He\n      whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of\n      many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul,\n      the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it\n      by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of\n      many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel,\n      any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great\n      destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an\n      involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures,\n      by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is\n      worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for\n      the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best\n      example of discipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to\n      Christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require\n      for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire\n      the PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and\n      unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last\n      instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every\n      kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy\n      experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the\n      unclean hand—it is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On\n      the contrary, in the so-called cultured classes, the believers in \"modern\n      ideas,\" nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy\n      insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger\n      everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE\n      nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the\n      lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the\n      newspaper-reading DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.", "264": " It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have\n      preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent\n      economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in\n      their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were\n      accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures\n      and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether,\n      finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of\n      birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith—for\n      their \"God,\"—as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which\n      blushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have\n      the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his\n      constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is\n      the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents, it\n      is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive\n      incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting—the\n      three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in\n      all times—such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood;\n      and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed\n      in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.—And what else does\n      education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very democratic, or\n      rather, very plebeian age, \"education\" and \"culture\" MUST be essentially\n      the art of deceiving—deceiving with regard to origin, with regard to\n      the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator who nowadays\n      preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out constantly to\n      his pupils: \"Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you are!\"—even\n      such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have\n      recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what results?\n      \"Plebeianism\" USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace's \"Epistles,\" I. x. 24.]", "265": " At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism\n      belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that\n      to a being such as \"we,\" other beings must naturally be in subjection, and\n      have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his\n      egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness,\n      constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may\n      have its basis in the primary law of things:—if he sought a\n      designation for it he would say: \"It is justice itself.\" He acknowledges\n      under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there\n      are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question\n      of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the\n      same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys\n      in intercourse with himself—in accordance with an innate heavenly\n      mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL instance of\n      his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his\n      equals—every star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them,\n      and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the\n      exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs\n      also to the natural condition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes,\n      prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at\n      the root of his nature. The notion of \"favour\" has, INTER PARES, neither\n      significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts\n      as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like\n      dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude.\n      His egoism hinders him here: in general, he looks \"aloft\" unwillingly—he\n      looks either FORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards—HE\n      KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT.", "266": " \"One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR himself.\"—Goethe\n      to Rath Schlosser.", "267": " The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:\n      \"SIAO-SIN\" (\"MAKE THY HEART SMALL\"). This is the essentially fundamental\n      tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient\n      Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans\n      of today—in this respect alone we should immediately be\n      \"distasteful\" to him.", "268": " What, after all, is ignobleness?—Words are vocal symbols for\n      ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for\n      frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations.\n      It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one\n      another: we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal\n      experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this\n      account the people of one nation understand one another better than those\n      belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or\n      rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of\n      climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an\n      entity that \"understands itself\"—namely, a nation. In all souls a\n      like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand\n      over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand\n      one another rapidly and always more rapidly—the history of language\n      is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick\n      comprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater the\n      danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what\n      is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in danger—that is\n      what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and\n      friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when\n      the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one of the two\n      parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different\n      from those of the other. (The fear of the \"eternal misunderstanding\": that\n      is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from\n      too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them—and NOT\n      some Schopenhauerian \"genius of the species\"!) Whichever groups of\n      sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the\n      word of command—these decide as to the general order of rank of its\n      values, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's\n      estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and\n      wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now\n      that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could\n      express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols,\n      it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which\n      implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences,\n      must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto\n      operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary people, have\n      always had and are still having the advantage; the more select, more\n      refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are liable to stand\n      alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate\n      themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart\n      this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution of man\n      to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious—to the\n      IGNOBLE—!", "269": " The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist and\n      soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases and\n      individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he\n      NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the\n      corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted\n      souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always\n      before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has\n      discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST\n      repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner \"desperateness\" of\n      higher men, this eternal \"too late!\" in every sense—may perhaps one\n      day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and\n      of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his \"going to ruin\"\n      himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale\n      inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered\n      men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that\n      he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight\n      and incisiveness—from what his \"business\"—has laid upon his\n      conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily\n      silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how\n      people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVED—or\n      he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible\n      opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that,\n      precisely where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great\n      CONTEMPT, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their\n      part learnt great reverence—reverence for \"great men\" and marvelous\n      animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the\n      earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the\n      young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all\n      great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude\n      worshipped a God, and that the \"God\" was only a poor sacrificial animal!\n      SUCCESS has always been the greatest liar—and the \"work\" itself is a\n      success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised\n      in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the \"work\" of the\n      artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is\n      REPUTED to have created it; the \"great men,\" as they are reverenced, are\n      poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical\n      values spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as\n      Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention\n      much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and\n      were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and\n      childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with\n      souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge\n      with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness\n      in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost\n      in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the\n      swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars—the people then call them idealists,—often\n      struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of\n      disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for GLORIA\n      and devour \"faith as it is\" out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:—what\n      a TORMENT these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general,\n      to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just\n      from woman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also\n      unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers—that\n      THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY,\n      which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand,\n      and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This\n      sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like\n      to believe that love can do EVERYTHING—it is the SUPERSTITION\n      peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor,\n      helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he\n      finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!—It is possible that under\n      the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of\n      the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the\n      martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had\n      enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and\n      frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against\n      those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and\n      insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those who\n      WOULD NOT love him—and that at last, enlightened about human love,\n      had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for love—who\n      takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has\n      such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE about love—SEEKS for\n      death!—But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided,\n      of course, that one is not obliged to do so.", "270": " The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has\n      suffered deeply—it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply\n      men can suffer—the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly\n      imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than\n      the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with,\n      and \"at home\" in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which \"YOU know\n      nothing\"!—this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this\n      pride of the elect of knowledge, of the \"initiated,\" of the almost\n      sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from\n      contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all\n      that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble: it\n      separates.—One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism,\n      along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes suffering\n      lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful\n      and profound. They are \"gay men\" who make use of gaiety, because they are\n      misunderstood on account of it—they WISH to be misunderstood.

Of\n      whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not\n      even told you his name?

For, as it happens to every one who from\n      childhood onward has always been on his legs, and in foreign lands, I have\n      also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits; above all,\n      however, and again and again, the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact,\n      no less a personage than the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and\n      tempter, to whom, as you know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence\n      my first-fruits—the last, as it seems to me, who has offered a\n      SACRIFICE to him, for I have found no one who could understand what I was\n      then doing. In the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much,\n      about the philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth—I,\n      the last disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at\n      last begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste\n      of this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do\n      with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The very\n      fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also\n      philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might\n      perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;—among you, my\n      friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too\n      late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you\n      are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that in\n      the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the\n      strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further,\n      very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of\n      me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according to\n      human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have to\n      extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty,\n      truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know what to do\n      with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. \"Keep that,\" he would say,\n      \"for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it! I—have\n      no reason to cover my nakedness!\" One suspects that this kind of divinity\n      and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?—He once said: \"Under certain\n      circumstances I love mankind\"—and referred thereby to Ariadne, who\n      was present; \"in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal,\n      that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all\n      labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can still further advance\n      him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound.\"—\"Stronger,\n      more evil, and more profound?\" I asked in horror. \"Yes,\" he said again,\n      \"stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautiful\"—and\n      thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had\n      just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it is not\n      only shame that this divinity lacks;—and in general there are good\n      grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come\n      to us men for instruction.
